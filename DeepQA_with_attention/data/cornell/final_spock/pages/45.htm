<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Doctor McCoy is sampling the local vegetation
when his communicator beeps.) <br>
MCCOY: Yes, Jim. <br>
KIRK [OC]: How much longer, McCoy? <br>
MCCOY: Oh, about another thirty minutes. I've come across some most
interesting organic compounds. Hey, Starfleet was right. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk is also on the planet.) <br>
MCCOY [OC]: These roots and soil cultures can be a medical treasure
house. Any problems there? <br>
KIRK: No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out. <br>
SPOCK: Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports? <br>
KIRK: Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several
days old. They seldom stay in one place. <br>
SPOCK: Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden? <br>
KIRK: Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first
planet survey. <br>
SPOCK: Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like. <br>
KIRK: Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and
arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves.
Remarkably peaceful and tranquil. <br>
VOICE [OC]: Ho! Take cover here! <br>
(Kirk and Spock dash off to investigate, and see three dark-haired
locals laying an ambush, armed with
long-barreled guns.) <br>
SPOCK: Bows and arrows, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Villagers with flintlocks? That's impossible. They hadn't
progressed nearly that far. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, look. <br>
(A group of blond hunters is approaching. They do have bows and
arrows.) <br>
KIRK: One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived
with here. (He draws his phaser.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden. <br>
(So instead Kirk throws a rock which startles a villager into firing
his weapon early.) <br>
TYREE: Villagers! <br>
(There's a chase, hunters after the villagers, and the villagers
pursuing Kirk and Spock. A shot is fired, which McCoy hears.) </font></p>

landing party. <br>
(Kirk and Spock come running, then Spock gets shot in the back.) <br>
KIRK: Spock? Your phaser. (it is missing, so Kirk prepares to use his
to defend his friend.) <br>
SPOCK: No, Captain. I can travel. <br>
(They join McCoy.) <br>
KIRK: Beam us up, quickly. <br>
MCCOY: Now, Scotty. Have medics stand by. <br>

KIRK: Lead projectile. Primitive firearm. <br>
M'BENGA: (an African doctor, to Nurse Chapel) Vitalizer B.&nbsp;<br>
MCCOY: Pressure packet. Lucky his heart's where his liver should be, or
he'd be dead now. <br>
M'BENGA: Not good, sir. <br>
MCCOY: Coranalin. <br>
KIRK: Bones, can you save him? <br>
UHURA [OC]: All decks, Red Alert! Battle stations, battle stations! Go
to Red Alert! <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Uhura, sir. We have a Klingon vessel on our screen. <br>
KIRK: On my way. Scotty. Bones? <br>

us and the Klingons. I don't think they've spotted us. <br>
UHURA: Make that definite, sir. They're sending a routine message to
their home base with no mention of us. <br>
KIRK: Good. Go to Yellow Alert. <br>
UHURA: Yellow Alert. All stations go to Yellow Alert. <br>
KIRK: Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: I can try, Captain. <br>
UHURA: Message to Starbase, sir? <br>
KIRK: No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find
out what's going on. <br>
SCOTT: We can hide for a while, sir, but we may have to go out of orbit
to keep it up for long. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Sickbay. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy here. I'll call you soon as I know anything. Sickbay
out. <br>
KIRK: So, they've broken the treaty. <br>
SCOTT: Not necessarily, Captain. They have as much right to scientific
missions here as we have. <br>
KIRK: Research is not the Klingon way. <br>
SCOTT: True, but since this is a hands-off planet, how are you going to
prove they're doing otherwise? <br>
KIRK: When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely
learned to forge iron. Spock was shot with a flintlock. How many
centuries between those two developments? <br>
UHURA: On Earth, about twelve, sir. <br>
SCOTT: On the other hand, a flintlock would be the first firearm the
inhabitants would normally develop. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott.&nbsp;<br>
CHEKOV: And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean
they had to. <br>
UHURA: We've seen different development at rates on different planets. <br>
SCOTT: And were the Klingons behind it, why didn't they give them
breechloaders? <br>
CHEKOV: Or machine guns? <br>
UHURA: Or old-style hand lasers? <br>
KIRK: I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and
concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there.
You have the conn, Scotty. I'll be in Sickbay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">M'BENGA: We've no replacements for the damaged
organs, sir. If he's going to live, his Vulcan physiology will have to
do it for him. <br>
MCCOY: Agreed. Sterilite off. <br>
CHAPEL: Yes, sir. <br>
MCCOY: He'll live or die now, Jim. I don't know which. Doctor M'Benga
interned on a Vulcan ward. He couldn't be in better hands. <br>
KIRK: Then you and I are transporting down. <br>
MCCOY: I can't leave Spock at this time. <br>
KIRK: You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their
mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic
potential, then you're the one man who can tell me. <br>
MCCOY: And if that's not it? <br>
KIRK: Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's. <br>
MCCOY: I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but <br>
KIRK: Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons
are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war. Kirk to Bridge. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Bridge, Scott here. <br>
KIRK: McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that
we'll need native costumes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Captain, we may have to break out of orbit
any minute to keep out of their sight. We'd be out of communicator
range with you. </font></p>

presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage, therefore I
cannot risk contact with Starfleet Command. I must take action on my
own judgment. I've elected to violate orders and make contact with
planet inhabitants.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(McCoy and Kirk are dressed in the leathers of hill
people.) <br>
KIRK: Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away. <br>
MCCOY: Want to think about it again, Jim? Starfleet's orders about this
planet state no interference with <br>
KIRK: No interference with normal social development. I'm not only
aware of it, it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it. <br>
MCCOY: I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left
alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and
peaceful culture. <br>
KIRK: Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You
coming with me? <br>
MCCOY: Do I have a choice? <br>
(So they make their way down the slope, and Kirk gets pounced on by a
big white ape with a large horn on it's head and spines down it's back.
It easily throws off McCoy as it concentrates on it's first victim,
biting him, Throwing rocks makes it stand up, then McCoy
vaporizes it with his phaser.) <br>
KIRK: (shaking) Contact ship. Took full poison. Fangs. <br>
MCCOY: Enterprise, McCoy. Emergency. Come in. Enterprise, come in.
McCoy! Emergency! <br>
KIRK: They left. Out of orbit. <br>
MCCOY: (giving an injection) Jim, there is no antitoxin for this
poison. I can only keep you alive a few hours with this. <br>
KIRK: Tyree. Some of his men. Cure. <br>
(Three men are standing in front of them.) <br>
MCCOY: Are you hill people? Do you know a hunter named Tyree? A mugato
attacked him. He's James Kirk. He's a friend of Tyree's.
Blast it! Do something! He's dying! <br>

right about the people here. Despite their fear and our strangeness,
they're compassionate and gentle. I've learned the hunter Tyree is now
their leader. He is expected to return shortly with his wife, who they
say knows how to cure this poison. My problem. The captain is in deep
shock. I must keep him warm and alive until then. <br>

after two armed villagers pass.) <br>
NONA: We must obtain the same firesticks, husband. You could be killing
them instead. We could take their houses, their goods. <br>
TYREE: Nona, enough. In time the villagers will return to their ways of
friendship. <br>
NONA: In time? They kill your people! I am a Kahn-ut-tu woman. In all
this land, how many are there? Men seek us because through us they
become great leaders. <br>
TYREE: I took you because you cast a spell upon me. <br>
NONA: And I have spells that help me keep you. Remember this leaf? The
night we camped by the water? <br>
TYREE: The night of madness. <br>
NONA: Oh, Tyree, did you really hate that madness? <br>
(She rubs the leaf down his arm, scratching him and leaving pieces
attached to his skin.) <br>
TYREE: No, Nona. No! It brought up evil beasts from my soul. <br>
NONA: Only one lovely beast, Tyree, my huge, angry man. <br>
(They kiss passionately.) <br>
YUTAN: Forgive me.&nbsp;<br>
NONA: What is it? <br>
YUTAN: There are strangers in our camp. One has taken the mugato bite.

TYREE: You must. He is the one I told you of. The friend of my younger

NONA: My remedies require I know what kind of man he is. All that is
known of him. <br>

Chapel is holding his hand, but puts it down quickly when the door
opens.) <br>
M'BENGA: Don't let these low panel readings bother you. I've seen this
before in Vulcans. It's their way of concentrating all their strength,
blood, and antibodies onto the injured organs. A form of self-induced
hypnosis. <br>
CHAPEL: You mean he's conscious? <br>
M'BENGA: Well, in a sense. He knows we're here and what we're saying,
but he can't afford to take his mind from the tissue he's fighting to
heal. I suppose he even knows you were holding his hand. (leaves) <br>

it. <br>
(She holds out her hand, and Tyree cuts it with his knife. Then she
starts writhing for a few moments before putting the mahko root onto
Kirk's wound and holding it there with her bleeding hand.) <br>
NONA: Take this of my soul. This of my soul. Thine own. Into thine.
Deeply. Together. Your pain is mine. All mine. Your soul and mine,
together! Return. It is past. Return. Return! <br>

chest. The root is
shriveled. Kirk wakes up.) <br>

MCCOY: I want to thank you for saving his life. (Nona's hand is healed
too) I would like to learn more about this. <br>

have been together. He is mine now. <br>

her no wish. But it is only legend. </font></p>

My old friend. <br>
TYREE: Yes, James! James, it's good to see you. <br>
KIRK: What am I doing here? A mugato bite! I remember. I told him to
take me to Tyree's camp. I knew you'd find a kahn-ut-tu to cure me. The
kahn-ut-tu is the local witch people here. They've studied (Nona gets
up and stands in front of him) They've studied the roots and the herbs.
<br>
NONA: I am a kahn-ut-tu, Captain. I cured you. <br>
TYREE: My wife, Nona. <br>
KIRK: Yes, of course. I should've guessed. Congratulations. Tyree, we
must talk now. The villagers, their new weapons. I want to hear all
about that. We must make plans. <br>
NONA: Good. It is past time to plan. <br>
TYREE: Much has happened since you left, James. Come, we'll speak of
it. <br>

someone with you constantly now. When the time comes, I'll be called.

immediately. <br>

ago. Since that time, many of my people have died. <br>
KIRK: You say they make the firesticks themselves? How can you be sure?
<br>
TYREE: I've looked into their village. I have seen it being done. <br>
MCCOY: Have you seen any strangers among the villagers? <br>
TYREE: Strangers? No. <br>
KIRK: Can you take us to their village while it's still dark? <br>
TYREE: Yes, but the mugatos travel at night also. You killed one. Its
mate will not be far. <br>
KIRK: (showing his phaser) You've seen how these work. <br>
NONA: I've seen them also, and I know you have many ways to make your
friend Tyree a man of great importance. <br>
MCCOY: Many ways? What else does she know about us? <br>
NONA: Tyree has told me much of you. Do not blame him. It was the price
for saving your life. <br>
KIRK: We're simply strangers from <br>
NONA: From one of the lights in the sky, and you have ways as far above
firesticks as the sky above our world. <br>
TYREE: You will not speak of this to others. <br>
NONA: I will not if I am made to understand. Teach me. There's an old
custom among my people. When a woman saves a man's life,
he is grateful. <br>
KIRK: I am grateful. <br>
MCCOY: A splendid custom if not carried to extremes. <br>
KIRK: We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when
our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed
ourselves. We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels,
Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds. Just as a man must
grow in his own way and in his own time. <br>
NONA: Some men never grow. <br>
KIRK: Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But
we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with
the way of a man or another world. <br>
NONA: You must let the villagers destroy us? You will not help your
friend and brother kill them instead? <br>
TYREE: No! I said I will not kill! <br>
NONA: We must fight or die! Is dying better? You would let him die when
you have weapons to make him powerful and safe? Then he has the wrong
friends. And I have the wrong husband. (leaves) <br>
TYREE: You will help in ways she does not understand. I have faith in
our friendship, James. Come, before we lose the darkness. (leaves) <br>
MCCOY: What's bothering you, Jim? If we find the Klingons have helped
the villagers, there's certainly something we can do. <br>

about the Klingons, Jim.

SPOCK: Nurse. <br>
CHAPEL: Yes? <br>
SPOCK: Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.<br>
CHAPEL: Hit you? No! I can't <br>
SPOCK: Blast you, strike me! If I don't regain consciousness soon, it
may be too late. Hit me. (she slaps his face) Harder! <br>
(She does, with tears in her eyes.) <br>
SPOCK: Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness. <br>
SCOTT: (running in and dragging her away) What are you doing, woman? <br>
CHAPEL: Leave me alone! <br>
SCOTT: Have you gone daft? <br>
CHAPEL: Mister Spock needs me! Let go! <br>
(M'Benga rushes in and helps Spock to sit up before giving him some
pretty vicious hits across the face. Scott stares, astonished. Finally
Spock grabs M'Benga's arm.) <br>
SPOCK: That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.&nbsp;<br>
M'BENGA: Please, release her. <br>
SCOTT: What's this all about? <br>
SPOCK: She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of
self-healing. <br>
M'BENGA: As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then
fight their way back to consciousness. <br>
CHAPEL: Here, let me help you, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered. <br>
CHAPEL: Yes, I see you are.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Just slightly away from the tents, Kirk is giving
a rifle shooting lesson.) <br>
KIRK: Men, this is the pan. This is the hammer. The hammer striking the
pan causes a spark, ignites the powder, and fires the flintlock. Now
aim it as I showed you. Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger
gently. (Tyree shoots the clay pot target) Well done. Very, very, very
good. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, I want to talk to you. <br>
KIRK: Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough
there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder. You
want to make sure they all know about it! <br>
KIRK: Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type
of firearm. <br>
MCCOY: Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's
wife, she said there was something in that root. She said now you can
refuse her nothing. <br>
KIRK: Superstition. <br>
MCCOY: Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants? <br>
KIRK: Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither
side can have. Bones. Bones, the normal development of this planet was
the status quo between the hill people and the villagers. The Klingons
changed that with the flintlocks. If this planet is to develop the way
it should, we must equalize both sides again. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war
that may never end. It could go on for year after year, massacre after
massacre. <br>
KIRK: All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say
the woman drugged me. What is your sober, sensible solution to all
this? <br>
MCCOY: I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is
certainly not the answer. <br>
KIRK: Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the
Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and
ourselves. Neither side felt could pull out. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year. <br>
KIRK: What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with
an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space
if they had. No. The only solution is what happened back then. Balance
of power. <br>
MCCOY: And if the Klingons give their side even more? <br>
KIRK: Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of
power. The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but
the only one that preserves both sides. <br>
MCCOY: And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this
balance of power? <br>
KIRK: No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him
understand. I never had a more difficult task. <br>
MCCOY: Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you. Since Tyree
won't fight, he will be one of the first to die. <br>
KIRK: Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life. His wife is the only
way to reach him. If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe
she'll convince him.

over a rock. She has been bathing.
KIRK: Nona. Pardon me. <br>
NONA: You are here because I wished you here. <br>
KIRK: Oh? I thought it was my idea. <br>
NONA: Yes. They always believe they come of free will. Tyree thought
the same when I cast my first spell on him. <br>
KIRK: Nona <br>
NONA: Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing. <br>
(It is the same planet that she used on Tyree.) <br>
KIRK: I'd like to talk to you. <br>
NONA: Again. Some find it soothing. Yes. <br>
KIRK: I would like <br>
NONA: Happy. Yes. You feel good. <br>

KIRK: I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful. <br>
(Tyree takes aim.) <br>
NONA: Kiss me. <br>
(Kirk gives in, but Tyree cannot bring himself to squeeze the trigger.
He throws the gun down in disgust and runs. Nona and Kirk are
interrupted by the shriek of a mugato. Kirk is so besotted that Nona
has difficulty getting out of his embrace and trying to escape.
Eventually Kirk thinks to draw his phaser and kill the attacking
creature. She decides to hit him over the head to get the phaser for
herself.)

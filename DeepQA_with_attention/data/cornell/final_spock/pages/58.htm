<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Conifers stand on the slopes down to a lake,
where three figures beam down onto a trackway.) <br>
MCCOY: Look at those pine trees. <br>
KIRK: And that lake. <br>
MCCOY: I swear that's honeysuckle I smell. <br>
KIRK: I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in. It's
unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a
galaxy away. What are the odds on such duplication? <br>
SPOCK: Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of
this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly
to Earth in any way. <br>
MCCOY: What in blazes is that? <br>
(A bizarre structure on a dais, with steps leading up to it.) <br>
KIRK: Analysis, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe.
Readings can't even measure its age accurately. These incised symbols
are fascinating. Evidently, some form of writing. <br>
KIRK: Any theories about what it is? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require
extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in
cultures surpassing or equalling our own. <br>
MCCOY: Meadows and no meteor craters. The whole place is an enigma,
biologically and culturally. <br>
KIRK: What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Bearing one one seven mark four. <br>
KIRK: And how much time did you say we have to investigate? <br>
SPOCK: If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course
with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes.
Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the
problem, perhaps past solution. <br>
KIRK: You did say thirty minutes? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this
environment. <br>
(Standing on the opposite side of the lake from a collection of tipis
and a lodge.) <br>
MCCOY: Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians. <br>
SPOCK: They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I
believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes. <br>
KIRK: It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it
possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this
planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector
system? <br>
SPOCK: Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type
of life form here. <br>
MCCOY: Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them? <br>
KIRK: Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world
into atoms? <br>
SPOCK: Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our
appearance here would only confuse and frighten them. <br>
KIRK: We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise. <br>
(Along the path.) <br>
MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim? <br>
KIRK: What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No
problems, no command decisions. Just living. <br>
MCCOY: Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in
the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome. It's
particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship
captains. <br>
KIRK: Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But
first I want another look at that obelisk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk walks up to it as McCoy scans with the
tricorder.) <br>
SPOCK: Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Yes. <br>
SPOCK: I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed
until after we have diverted the asteroid. <br>
KIRK: (standing next to the symbols) Kirk to Enterprise. (and drops
suddenly out of our sight) <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Yes, sir. <br>

electrical discharge. He collapses across a control panel.) </font></p>

disappeared.) <br>
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. <br>
SCOTT [IC]: Enterprise. Come in, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit.
<br>
MCCOY: Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon.
Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid
destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the
angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship <br>
MCCOY: The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months,
Spock! <br>
SPOCK: If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get
here at all. <br>
MCCOY: In the meantime, what about Jim? <br>
SPOCK: Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and
resume the search. <br>
MCCOY: That may be hours from now. He may be injured or dying. <br>
SPOCK: (picking up two stoned to illustrate his point) Doctor, assume
this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we
don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically
impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this
planet will die, including the captain. <br>
MCCOY: Can a few more minutes matter, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid
has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the
likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott.

and to her handmaiden from the walls of the temple, just as our legend
foretells. We do not doubt the words of our priestess, but these are
troubled times, and we must be sure. <br>
KIRK: I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are
strange to me. <br>
SALISH: He knows nothing of our danger. How could he save us? <br>
ELDER: It is against custom to interrupt a tribal elder at council,
even for the medicine chief. <br>
SALISH: Elder, words will not save us when the skies darken. We must be
certain. I say he must prove he is a god. <br>
ELDER: Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest. The last
time worst of all. Our legend predicts such danger and promises that
the Wise Ones who planted us here will send a god to save us, one who
can rouse the temple spirit and make the sky grow quiet. Can you do
this? <br>
KIRK: I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning
for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I
can't remember. <br>
MIRAMANEE: Salish, a terrible thing has happened. The boy was attending
the fishnets, and he became entangled in them and sank to the bottom of
the river. Lumo brought him up quickly, but he doesn't move. <br>
SALISH: There is no sound in the body. There is no light in the eyes.
He will move no more. <br>
KIRK: Wait a moment. <br>
(Kirk gives the kiss of life.) <br>
ELDER: Wait. <br>
(Kirk massages the boy's legs and he coughs, waking up.) <br>
KIRK: He'll be all right now. <br>
ELDER: My people are grateful. <br>
KIRK: It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back. <br>
ELDER: Only a god can breathe life into the dead. Do you still
question? Give him the medicine badge. <br>
Miramanee takes the headband with the metal disc from Salish's head and

SPOCK: To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will
split that mass. <br>

back, and I see faces, too. Very dim. I feel I should know know them. I
feel my place is with them, not here. I don't deserve this happiness. <br>
MIRAMANEE: I have a gift for you. <br>
KIRK: A gift? What? <br>
MIRAMANEE: It may make you happy. Wait. <br>
KIRK [OC]: These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger
with each passing day. However, the dreams return every night.
Fragments of memories. I can almost get hold of them, and then <br>
(Miramanee returns with what native american women carry their babies
in.) <br>
MIRAMANEE: I bear your child. <br>
KIRK: You! <br>
(They embrace again.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lodge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk has made a puddle in the mud floor of their
home and is explaining irrigation to Miramanee.) <br>
KIRK: A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to
the lodge. And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and
double the food supply. <br>
MIRAMANEE: And with the power of the lamp. Lamp? <br>
KIRK: Lamp. <br>
MIRAMANEE: Which turns night into day, we can cook twice as much food,
and as you taught us, pre <br>
KIRK: Preserve. <br>
MIRAMANEE: Preserve. <br>
KIRK: Preserve. <br>
MIRAMANEE@ For times of famine. That is why you made the lamp, Kirok,
so that I would never know when it was night, and I would be forever
cooking. <br>
KIRK: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at
all, to keep you forever cooking. <br>
(Thunder and lightning as they kiss, then a wind starts up.) <br>
KIRK: It's only the wind and the thunder. <br>
MIRAMANEE: I act like a stupid child. I have nothing to fear. You are
here. (she looks outside) It is time. <br>
KIRK; Time? <br>
MIRAMANEE: To go to the temple. The people will be waiting. <br>
KIRK: Why? <br>
MIRAMANEE: To save them. <br>
KIRK: But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them. <br>
MIRAMANEE: The wind is only the beginning. Soon the sky will darken,
the lake will go wild, and the earth will tremble. Only you can save
us. <br>
KIRK: But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky. <br>
MIRAMANEE: If we don't go now, it will be too late. You must go inside
the temple and make the blue flame come out. <br>
KIRK: I don't know how to get inside the temple. <br>
MIRAMANEE: But you are a god. <br>
ELDER: (bursting in) Kirok! Kirok! <br>
SALISH: Why are you not at the temple, Kirok? Soon the ground will
begin to tremble. The people need your help. <br>
KIRK: We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there. <br>
SALISH: The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his
people. <br>
ELDER: When the ground trembles the caves are not safe, Kirok. If you
do not rouse the temple spirit, we will all die. <br>
MIRAMANEE: There is nothing you cannot do, my husband. <br>
SALISH: Well, what do you wait for, god? Your robes? <br>
KIRK: Take care of Miramanee. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Obelisk]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Salish watches from a distance as Kirk beats on
the obelisk's wall trying to work out how to get inside.) <br>
KIRK: I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok! <br>
(Salish smiles at his failure.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Spock's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spock is playing his lyre.) <br>
MCCOY: I prescribed sleep. <br>
SPOCK: You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not
words. They are musical notes. <br>
MCCOY: Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song? <br>
SPOCK: In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan
offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to
an alphabet. <br>
MCCOY: Were you able to make sense our of the symbols? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by
a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy
rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and
seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow. <br>
MCCOY: I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered
through the galaxy. <br>
SPOCK: So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of
them. <br>
MCCOY: That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries.
The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet. <br>
SPOCK: Which has now become defective and is failing to operate. <br>
MCCOY: And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working
order, otherwise <br>
SPOCK: Precisely, Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Salish has brought a crowd armed with stones.) <br>
SALISH: There's the false one! <br>
(They throw their stones at Kirk.)
ALL: Die! Die! Die! <br>
MIRAMANEE: No! No! Don't hurt him! <br>
(Salish holds her back.) <br>
KIRK: Miramanee! <br>
MIRAMANEE: Don't hurt him! He can save us! <br>
SALISH: He's false! <br>
MIRAMANEE: I belong to him. <br>
SALISH: Then go. Go die with your false god. <br>
ALL: You'll be killed! Kill him! We're all doomed! Die, impostor! You
lied to us! You're not a god! We'll kill you now! <br>
(Spock and McCoy beam down as Miramanee and Kirk fall under the hail of
stones. The crowd runs away when they see them. McCoy checks Kirk
first.) <br>
MCCOY: I need Nurse Chapel. <br>
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Come in, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an
emergency surgical kit. <br>
KIRK: My wife. Is she all right? <br>
MCCOY: Wife? <br>
SPOCK: Hallucinations? <br>
(Chapel beams down.) <br>
KIRK: Miramanee. <br>
(Spock rolls Miramanee onto her back, and Chapel gives her an
injection.) <br>
SPOCK: The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you
being stoned? <br>
MIRAMANEE: Kirok could not get back into the temple. <br>
SPOCK: Naturally, since he did not come from there. <br>
MIRAMANEE: I saw him come, come. <br>
CHAPEL: Does he recognise us? <br>
MCCOY: His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally
normally except his memory. <br>
SPOCK:: Can you help him? <br>
MCCOY: It'd take time. <br>
SPOCK: Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in
abundance. (communicator beeps) Spock here. <br>
SULU [OC]: Tracking report, sir. Sixty five minutes to end of safety
margin. <br>
SPOCK: Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind
fusion? <br>
MCCOY: We have no choice. <br>
(So Spock places his hands on Kirk's face and starts the procedure.) <br>
SPOCK: I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer.
Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk. Closer. <br>
KIRK: No! <br>
SPOCK: James Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Miramanee! No! Miramanee! <br>
SPOCK: Our minds are one. <br>
BOTH: I am Kirok. I am Kirok. <br>
SPOCK: I am Kir <br>
KIRK: I am Kirok! I am <br>
SPOCK: Spock! <br>
(He breaks the link) <br>
MCCOY: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual. <br>
KIRK: It worked. <br>
(Kirk goes to Miramanee.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, were you inside this structure? <br>
KIRK: Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment. <br>
SPOCK: This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative
that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time. <br>
KIRK: McCoy. <br>
(McCoy and Chapel start tending to Miramanee.) <br>
KIRK: I don't know how to get inside. <br>
SPOCK: If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector
mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be
destroyed. <br>
KIRK: The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them. <br>
SPOCK: I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes. <br>
KIRK: You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a
musical instrument? <br>
SPOCK: That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal
qualities spoken in their proper sequence. <br>
KIRK: Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels.
I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship. <br>
SPOCK: If you could remember your exact words, Captain. <br>
KIRK: (flipping open the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
(The hatch slides open, with Miramanee still lying on it.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes,
get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone. The
landing party is expendable. The Enterprise isn't. Kirk out. Miramanee.
Bones, stay with her. Do what you can. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: It is similar to deflector panels I've seen,
Captain, but far more complicated. <br>
KIRK: Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me
and that's when I stopped remembering. <br>
SPOCK: Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of
sequence. <br>
KIRK: More symbols. Can you read them? <br>
SPOCK: I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They
would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their

(Spock presses the middle button of a row of three, and other sections
light up. A blue beam shoots out of the top of the obelisk and pushes
the asteroid away.)

MCCOY: No. <br>

KIRK: And so are your people, Miramanee. <br>
MIRAMANEE: I knew you would save them, my chief. When I am better, it
will be as it was, will it not? <br>
KIRK: If that's what you want. <br>
MIRAMANEE: We will live long and happy lives. I will bear you many

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA: Still no response, sir. <br>
KIRK: No, keep it open. I don't like this. Nothing since the first
check in. Scott and Sulu should've contacted us again a half an hour
ago. <br>
SPOCK: They may have nothing to report. Our sensors indicate no life
forms except our landing party. <br>
KIRK: Both those men are well aware of landing party procedure. They
should've checked in with us by now. <br>
UHURA: Contact established, Captain. <br>
JACKSON [OC]: Jackson to Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: Enterprise. Kirk here. <br>
JACKSON [OC]: One to beam up, Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: One? Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu?<br>
JACKSON [OC]: I'm ready to beam up, sir. <br>
KIRK: Jackson! <br>
UHURA: I'm sorry. I can't clear it, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Notify Transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the
landing party. Then have Doctor McCoy report to me in the Transporter
room on the double. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. </font></p>

KIRK: Energise. <br>
MCCOY: What's on, Jim? <br>
KIRK: Trouble. (one man materialises) Jackson, where are the others? <br>
(The man falls over and off the transporter platform.) <br>
MCCOY: The man is dead. <br>
KOROB [OC]: (from the mouth of Jackson) Captain Kirk, can you hear me?
There is a curse on your ship. Leave this place or you will all die.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Log, stardate 3018.2. Crewman Jackson is
dead and there are no apparent physical causes. Mister Scott and Mister
Sulu are still out of touch on the planet below. Leaving Assistant
Chief Engineer DeSalle in command of the Enterprise, I'm beaming down
to the planet's surface to find my two missing crewmen and discover
what killed Jackson.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's rocky, and misty. Very spooky.) <br>
KIRK: Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog. <br>
SPOCK: No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface
temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain.
According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location
from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship. <br>
(They step down carefully into the mist swirling along the path.) <br>
KIRK: Readings, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form
readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point
one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain. <br>
MCCOY: Scott and Sulu? <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Enterprise. Lieutenant Uhura here. <br>
KIRK: What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DESALLE: Report, Mister. <br>
CHEKOV: I am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them.
As far as instruments can make out, there is nothing else down there
that's alive. <br>
DESALLE: Relay, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Captain, we are only registering on you. (static) Captain?
Captain Kirk? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Lieutenant, can you hear me? <br>
MCCOY: Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker. Suppose that has
anything to do with the interference? <br>
KIRK: I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that
the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking
up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: No change, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Stand-by alert. <br>
(They check their phasers.) <br>
MCCOY: Listen. Now, what do you think that <br>
KIRK: Quiet. <br>
(There's an eerie wailing, then the images of, well, the Three Witches
from Macbeth, appear.)<br>
WITCH 1: Captain Kirk! <br>
WITCH 2: Captain Kirk! <br>
WITCH 3: Captain Kirk! <br>
KIRK: Who are you? <br>
WITCH 1: Go back! <br>
WITCH 2: Go back! <br>
WITCH 3: Go back! Remember the curse! <br>
WITCH 1: Wind shall rise. <br>
WITCH 2: And fog descend. <br>
WITCH 3: So leave here, all, or meet your end. <br>
(Maniacal cackling as they vanish. ) <br>
KIRK: Spock. Comment? <br>
SPOCK: Very bad poetry, Captain. <br>
KIRK: A more useful comment, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: What we've just seen is not real. <br>
KIRK: That's useful. <br>
SPOCK: However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred
metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but
definitely registering. <br>
KIRK: That's where we're going. <br>
(A strong gust of wind blows them back.) <br>
MCCOY: That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock. <br>
(They walk on again.) <br>
MCCOY: Jim. <br>
(There is a castle hewn from the local rock, and a door is opening.) <br>
SPOCK: This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're
inside, somewhere. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. <br>
MCCOY: Is this how we lost contact with the first landing party? <br>
KIRK: What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do
with communicator interference? <br>
SPOCK: I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that
would cause such interference. <br>
KIRK: And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors. <br>
SPOCK: Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside. <br>
KIRK: Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into
our sensor scan. <br>
MCCOY: Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it? <br>
KIRK; Would it? I wonder. <br>
(They approach the edifice cautiously, then enter.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Castle]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They are greeted by an angry, spitting black cat,
wearing a large gem on its collar. It runs off, tail bristling.) <br>
MCCOY: Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat. <br>
KIRK: If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say
someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us. <br>
SPOCK: Trick or treat, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one
day. Shall we have a look around? <br>
SPOCK: That would seem to be in order. <br>
KIRK: (sending them off in different directions) Bones. Spock. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHEKOV: They're gone, Mister DeSalle. The captain
and the others simply stopped registering. <br>
DESALLE: Check for malfunctions. <br>
CHEKOV: I did, sir, as soon as it happened. <br>
UHURA: Mister DeSalle, that's exactly what happened to Mister Scott and
his party. They, they just disappeared. <br>
DESALLE: Nobody just disappears. They may have encountered a magnetic
field or some other obstruction. Mister Chekov, recalibrate your
sensors.
If you need help <br>
CHEKOV: I can do it, sir. I'm not that green. <br>
DESALLE: Lieutenant Uhura, continue in your efforts to break through
that static interference. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
DESALLE: We know they're down there. I want them found. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Castle]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The main door slams shut behind them.) <br>
KIRK: Straight ahead, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: The readings would so indicate. <br>
(Unlike a real castle, this one is all corridors at present.) <br>
MCCOY: Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right. <br>
(The black cat is ahead of them when the stone floor gives way and
dumps the trio into )
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Dungeon]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Reasonably well equipped out of Edgar Allen Poe -
rack, skeleton in iron cage - and our heroes chained to the wall.) <br>
KIRK: Spock. Are you all right? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. I am undamaged, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Bones? (sees another skeleton chained to the wall) Doc? <br>
MCCOY: You were saying something about trick or treat.<br>
KIRK: Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth
manifestations. Why? <br>
SPOCK: I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are
real. <br>
MCCOY: Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort? <br>
KIRK: None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a
human nightmare. <br>
SPOCK: As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an
instinctive level. <br>
KIRK: Ghost stories, ogres, demons. The whole <br>
(Footsteps, then the dungeon door opens. Down the steps walk - Scott
and Sulu! as if in a trance.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty, Sulu. Scotty. Put down the phaser. Scotty! <br>
MCCOY: They appear to be drugged, Jim. Look at their eyes. Hardly blink
at all. <br>
SPOCK: Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed. <br>
KIRK: These two are alive. Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know
who I am? What's happened to you? <br>
(Sulu holds up a very big key ring) <br>
MCCOY: They're going to release us. <br>
(Sulu undoes their shackles and they start to leave. They begin to
fight, but suddenly)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KOROB: Stop! <br>
(Red plush furnishings and a bald man with a little beard, wearing a
golden gown, is sitting on what is effectively a throne on a raised
dais.) <br>
KIRK: Whoever you are, you've proven your skill at creating illusion.
Now I want to know why and what you've done to my men. <br>
KOROB: Where did your race get this ridiculous predilection for
resistance? You examine any object, you question everything. Is it not
enough to accept what is? <br>
KIRK: Not when one of my men is dead because of it and two others
turned into mindless <br>
KOROB: NO, not mindless. These two are merely controlled, Captain Kirk.
Oh, yes, we know who you are. All of you. (to the cat) Don't we, my
precious? <br>
KIRK: Who are you? Why did you bring us here? <br>
KOROB: My name is Korob. And as for bringing you here, it was you who
quite contrarily insisted upon coming. You were warned to stay away. <br>
KIRK: Why? For what reason? Why all the mumbo-jumbo? <br>
KOROB: Mumbo-jumbo? (the cat meows as if explaining) Oh! Oh, no, I
assure you it was not that, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There
never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven. <br>
KOROB: It is of no importance that we are not native to this planet.
(meow) Oh! I'm
told that I've been an inattentive host, gentlemen. You will join me
for something to refresh yourselves. <br>
(He leaves his throne and the cat follows.) <br>
MCCOY: That cat. <br>
KIRK: That cat. <br>
SPOCK: There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their
familiars. <br>
MCCOY: Familiars? <br>
SPOCK: Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard. <br>
KIRK: Superstition. <br>
SPOCK: I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it. <br>
KOROB: You are the different one, Mister Spock. You do not think like
the others. There are no colours to your patterns of logic. There's
only black and white. You see all this around you, yet you do not
believe. <br>
MCCOY: He doesn't know about trick or treat. <br>
KOROB: I do not understand that reference, therefore it also is of no
importance. Gentlemen, I can be most hospitable. <br>
(He waves his wand and the table is loaded with food.) <br>
SPOCK: Ingenious. <br>
KOROB: Do be seated. <br>
MCCOY: We're not hungry. <br>
KOROB: But I insist. <br>
(They seat themselves.) <br>
KIRK: All right, Korob. What do you want from us? <br>
KOROB: For the moment, merely that you eat and enjoy. Oh, Doctor, do
try the wine. You'll find it excellent. <br>
KIRK: You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining
yourself. <br>
KOROB: Hopefully I can change that attitude. <br>
(The food vanishes and their plates are now filled with cut gemstones.)
<br>
MCCOY: These look real. <br>
KOROB: They are, I assure you. Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires.
All the crystalline forms that you cherish above all things. A fortune
of them for each of you if you leave here without further inquiry. <br>
KIRK: We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship. They mean
nothing to us. <br>
KOROB: Valueless? I don't understand. I read <br>
KIRK: Whatever it is you read, you read it wrong. As for leaving, we'll
leave when we're ready. <br>
KOROB: You are most unpredictable. Perhaps I have made a small mistake.
Nevertheless, you have passed the tests. <br>
MCCOY: Tests? <br>
KOROB: Yes. Our analysis of you may have been in some small way in
error, but you were warned to stay away and yet you came to save your
comrades. That proves loyalty. Your bravery was tested and you did not
frighten. And despite my failure with these bright baubles, I perceive
that you cannot be bribed. In many ways you are quite admirable. (meow)
Quite right. Go at once, yes. <br>
(The cat leaves, and a few moments later a dark haired woman in a loose
black dress enters the room. She is wearing a pendant like the cat's
collar.) <br>
KOROB: Gentlemen, my colleague. Sylvia. <br>
SYLVIA: Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Captain Kirk. You wanted to know
what we did to your men. Actually it's a simple matter for us to probe
the minds of creatures like yourself. <br>
SPOCK: Mind probing? Hypnosis? <br>
SYLVIA: You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures, but
you're flawed. One gains admittance to your minds through many levels.
You have too many to keep track of yourselves. There are unguarded
entrances to any human mind. <br>
SPOCK: Telepathy? <br>
SPOCK: Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure
you that I have full control over your friends. <br>
(Kirk gets the phaser off Scott by throwing gems in his face.) <br>
KIRK: Don't move! (hands it to Spock) Cover them. Now, I want the rest
of our weapons and our equipment. I want some answers. <br>
SYLVIA: Put that weapon down! Captain, it seems so foolish of you to
insist on demonstrations. (She holds up a model Enterprise on a chain)
In the mythology of your race this is called sympathetic magic.
Jackson, the crew member who returned to the ship. You wondered what
killed him. I made an image of him. In the essence of my thoughts the
image was Jackson. And when I killed the image and knew that it was
dead, he died. <br>
KIRK: You can't think a man to death. <br>
SYLVIA: Your communicator. (it appears on the table) Now, signal your
ship. <br>
(She moves the model into a candle flame.) <br>
KOROB: Don't. Sylvia, don't. <br>

science. Now tell us about yours. <br>
KIRK: You seem to be singing a different tune. I'd rather know more
about yours. You call it magic, you call it science. It seems unrelated
to both of them. <br>
KOROB: What would you name it, Captain? <br>
KIRK: I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind
what we do with tools. You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis. <br>
KOROB: Yes, we can change the molecular structure <br>
SYLVIA: Korob, you talk too much. <br>
MCCOY: You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here. How'd
you know we'd come? <br>
KOROB: Oh, we didn't have to know. They knew. <br>
SYLVIA: Enough of this! You will tell us what we want to know. <br>
KIRK: It's too late for threats. You let me contact the ship. How long
do you think it will it be before a search party arrives? <br>
KOROB: Some time, Captain. Quite some time. <br>
(The model Enterprise is encased in a block of perspex.) <br>
KOROB: There will be no search party, Captain Kirk. An impenetrable
force field around your ship, Captain. It will not hinder orbit, but
your people are prisoners within it. </font></p>

SPOCK: I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that
we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite
familiar. <br>
KIRK: Familiar. Startling. Not rational. <br>
SPOCK: Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial
subconscious. The universal myths, symbols. <br>
KIRK: Ghosts, witches. <br>
SPOCK: And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the
twilight world of consciousness. <br>
KIRK: They tried to tap our conscious mind. <br>
SPOCK: And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious.
Korob seemed
puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided. <br>
KIRK: He expected me to react as though it were all normal. Well, he
admitted that they weren't native to this planet. <br>
SPOCK: And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most
unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy. <br>
KIRK: They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species
that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what
they're really like. <br>
SPOCK: Evidently something totally alien in all respects. <br>
KIRK: Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing
such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like
friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the
moment <br>
SPOCK: I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action.

KIRK: What now? You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too? <br>
SYLVIA: There's no real damage to the mind, Captain, simply a drain of
knowledge and will. <br>
KIRK: You don't call that damage? <br>
SYLVIA: Why should I? <br>
KIRK: You'd know if you had compassion. A woman should have compassion,
but I forget you're not a woman. <br>
SYLVIA: But you're mistaken, Captain. I am a woman now. I come from a
world without sensation as you and I now know it. It excites me. I want
more. <br>
KIRK: You seem to need us. Why? <br>
SYLVIA: Because you have knowledge which I lack. but were our abilities
put together. Tell me about power, Captain. How does it feel? <br>

shoulder. He strokes her neck and face.) <br>

SYLVIA: He is a fool. I'll do without him. But you? Why do I find you
different? Why would it be so difficult to dispose of you? <br>

SYLVIA: No, not that, not for you. What I want is a joining. My mind to
yours willingly. Think of the secrets you could learn. Think of the
power that would be yours. Anything you can imagine, I can give you. <br>
KIRK: You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along? <br>
SYLVIA: Then everything would be ours together. I've never conceived of
the idea of togetherness before. It excites me. You excite me. Why? <br>
KIRK: For the same reasons you excite me. You're a very beautiful
woman. <br>
(He kisses her.) <br>
SYLVIA: You find me beautiful? But I can be many women. (now she's
blonde teen jail-bait) You like what you see. (a platinum blonde in a
loose cat-suit) or do you prefer me as I was? <br>
KIRK: You have a knack for giving me difficult choices. (kisses her
again) You have nothing like that where you come from? <br>
SYLVIA: Nothing. <br>
KIRK: Your people, when they come here <br>
SYLVIA: They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter.
<br>
KIRK: (nuzzling her neck) Transmuter? <br>
SYLVIA: The source. You will learn. I will teach you later. Later. <br>
KIRK: Then it's a device. You do use tools. <br>
SYLVIA: It gives only form. You're teaching me substance. <br>
KIRK: You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home? <br>
SYLVIA: My home is here with you. A billion worlds of sensation to pick
and choose. <br>
(Another kiss, then he lets her go and she realises ) <br>
SYLVIA: You are using me. You hold me in your arms and there is no fire
in your mind. You're trying to deceive me! It's here, (the crystal)
like words on a page. You are using me. <br>
KIRK: And why not? You've been using me and my crew. <br>
(Enter Sulu, Scott and McCoy.) <br>
SYLVIA: You will be swept away. You, your men, your ship, your worlds! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA: I don't see any change. <br>
DESALLE: It's there, Lieutenant. <br>
CHEKOV: It was that electrical field we set up, Mister DeSalle, that
dent you wanted. It's not much, but it is a start. <br>
DESALLE: Keep it up, Mister Chekov. Channel the entire output of
reactors one, two, and three into the relay stations. Whatever it is,
it's starting to weaken. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Dungeon]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Korob rushes in and releases the prisoners.) <br>
KOROB: I've released the model of your ship from the crystal, although
they would have freed themselves soon. It's difficult to control so
many things in so little time. (hands over phaser and communicator)
Here. You must go before she finds the weapon is missing. <br>
KIRK: I'm not leaving without my men. <br>
KOROB: They're not your men anymore. They belong to Sylvia. I can no
longer control them or her. She's irrational. The strain of adopting to
your form, the insatiable desire for sensation and experience. She's a
great danger and it was not necessary. We could have entered your
galaxy in peace. <br>
SPOCK: You came in a ship? <br>
KOROB: We used the transmuter. <br>
KIRK: Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that. <br>
KOROB: There's no time to explain now. She means to destroy us all.
There might still be a chance. Quickly. Come. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Castle]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They go cautiously along the corridors, and a
cat's snarl is heard. There on a wall is the shadow of a very large
feline.)<br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: Why a cat? <br>
SPOCK: Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying
of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger. <br>
KOROB: I think I can stop her. <br>
KIRK: You'd better let us. (draws the phaser) It's out of energy. She
must have drained it. We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time.
We didn't know. No way out. <br>
KOROB: It's my problem. She's one of my kind. Come quickly. <br>
(The giant cat pads down the corridor as they retreat back into the
dungeon.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Dungeon]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spock goes to the hole in the ceiling that they
originally fell through.) <br>
KIRK: Do you think you can make it? <br>
SPOCK: Ready when you are, Captain. <br>
KIRK: (to Korob) Get ready. <br>
(Spock gets out into the corridor above.) <br>
KOROB: No! Get back. Get back. Get back! Get back! <br>
KIRK: Korob, that door won't last. <br>
KOROB: Get back! <br>
(The door is pushed in and he is crushed underneath it. Kirk runs to
his aid.) <br>
KOROB: Go. Go! (He dies, and Kirk picks up his wand.) <br>
SPOCK: Quickly, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Korob seemed to think this was important. Said something about a
transmuter. <br>
(He throws the wand up to Spock.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please. <br>
(Kirk uses a bed frame as a trampoline to help him reach the hole, and
Spock pulls him the rest of the way.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Castle]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Captain. <br>
(McCoy arrives to take a swing at them with a morning-star. Kirk fights
with him as Spock takes on Scott. Kirk knocks McCoy out.) <br>
KIRK: Doc. <br>
(Then Sulu arrives. Spock neck-pinches Scott. Kirk parries Sulu's
martial arts attack until he can throw him against a door, when he is
knocked out.) <br>
SPOCK: Jim! <br>
(McCoy has awakened only to get knocked out again.) <br>
KIRK: Well, at least we found them. <br>
SPOCK: Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together?
(the cat arrives) A most unpleasant situation, Captain. If only your
phaser had some power. <br>
KIRK: Maybe we do. (he gets the wand) Sylvia, I have the transmuter.
It's mine now. <br>
SYLVIA: You're very clever, Captain. More so than I'd imagined. Clever,
resourceful and handsome. <br>
SPOCK: Don't let her touch the wand, Captain. <br>
(She strokes her pendant, and she and Kirk vanish.) <br>
SPOCK: Jim! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Drawing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Don't you get tired of these games? <br>
SYLVIA: I've never played games. Give it to me. <br>
KIRK: I wasn't sure before, but I am now. This is the source of your
power, isn't it. The transmuter. <br>
SYLVIA: No, not the source. It's merely an amplifier. The mind is the
source. Mine is simple, but yours has the key but you don't know how to
use it. <br>
KIRK: I catch on quickly. <br>
SYLVIA: It is not too late, Captain James Kirk. Come with me. I'll
teach you. You'll teach me. <br>
KIRK: Why? Because your people have nothing of your own? Is that why
you need us? <br>
SYLVIA: We need your dreams, your ambition. With them, I can build.
Give me the transmuter. <br>
KIRK: No. <br>
SYLVIA: You fool. Don't you know what you're giving up? Everything that
your species finds desirable. Look at me. I am a woman. I am all women.
<br>
KIRK: I don't know what you are but you're not a woman. You've tortured
my men and taken their minds from them. You ask for love and return
pain instead. <br>
SYLVIA: (holding a phaser) Korob was wrong. I didn't destroy all your
weapons. Give me the transmuter. Give it to me! <br>
(Kirk smashes the wand against the table, and there is a blinding blue
light.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk is standing on the rocks holding a phaser.
Spock approaches wearing his tricorder. McCoy, Scott and Sulu follow
him.) <br>
MCCOY: What happened, Jim? <br>
KIRK: That'll take some explaining, Bones. <br>
SCOTT: Everything's vanished. <br>
KIRK: Not everything. <br>
(By his feet are two tiny blue fluffy creatures with stick-thin arms
and legs, and squid's tentacles for faces.) <br>
KIRK: Korob and Sylvia as they really are. Their forms were an
illusion, just like the castle and everything else. Only the power pack
gave them reality. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we
could preserve and study this <br>
(But the little puppets collapse and die. Smoke rises from the bodies.)<br>
MCCOY: Too late. All of this, just an illusion. <br>
KIRK: No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Standing by, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Five to beam up. </font> </p>

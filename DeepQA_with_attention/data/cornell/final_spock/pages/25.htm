<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PAINTER: Approaching Omicron Ceti Three, sir. <br>
KIRK: Standard orbit, Mister Painter. <br>
PAINTER: Yes, sir. <br>
UHURA: Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: I've been transmitting a contact signal every five minutes. All
I get is dead air. Shall I continue? <br>
KIRK: Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and
children in that colony. What are the chances of survivors? <br>
SPOCK: Absolutely none, Captain. Berthold rays are such a recent
discovery. We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. It is
known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure.
Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years. <br>
KIRK: Are you saying that those people built a future in a place
knowing they might not survive? <br>
SPOCK: I am saying they knew there was a risk. <br>
KIRK: And what about us? Can we afford to send people to the planet's
surface? <br>
SPOCK: The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can
risk a limited exposure. <br>
PAINTER: We've established orbit, sir, and I've pinpointed a
settlement. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of
five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and
a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes. </font></p>

wooden fence and a tarmacadamed paths. There are clap-board buildings
and even a stable block.) <br>
KIRK: Another dream that failed. There's nothing sadder. It took these
people a year to make the trip from Earth. They came all that way and
died. <br>
ELIAS: Hardly that, sir. Welcome to Omicron Ceti Three. I'm Elias
Sandoval.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 3417.3. We thought our
mission to Omicron Ceti Three would be an unhappy one. We had expected
to find no survivors of the agricultural colony there. Apparently, our
information was incorrect.

four years since we left Earth. We've been expecting someone for some
time. Our subspace radio didn't work properly, and I'm afraid we didn't
have anyone who could master its intricacies. <br>
KIRK: Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your
silent radio. <br>
ELIAS: It makes little difference, Captain. You're here. We're happy to
see you. Come, let me show you our settlement. <br>
MCCOY: On pure speculation, just an educated guess, I'd say that man is
alive. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our
reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if
necessary. But <br>
KIRK: But these people shouldn't be alive. <br>
SULU: Is it possible that they're not? <br>
MCCOY: You shook hands with him, Jim. His flesh was warm. He's alive.
There's no doubt about that. <br>
SPOCK: There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are
incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor,
you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed
long enough, he dies. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum. Let's go get some answers.

wooden furniture and gingham curtains.) <br>
ELIAS: There are two other settlements, but we have forty five
colonists here. <br>
KIRK: What was the reason for the dispersal? <br>
ELIAS: We felt three groups would have better potential. If disease
were to strike one group, the others would be less likely to be
affected. You see, Omicron is an ideal agricultural planet. We
determined not to suffer the fate of expeditions that went before us. <br>
LEILA: Elias. <br>
ELIAS: Leila, come meet our guests. This is Leila Kalomi, our botanist.
This is Captain Kirk, Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock. <br>
LEILA: Mister Spock and I have met before. It's been a long time. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests. <br>
ELIAS: By all means, make them. I think you'll find our settlement an
interesting one. Our philosophy is a simple one, that men should return
to a less complicated life. We have few mechanical things here. No
vehicles, no weapons. We have harmony here. Complete peace. <br>
KIRK: We'll try not to interfere with your work. <br>

true, sir. They've got a variety of crops in. Grains, potatoes, beans. <br>
KIRK: Make your point. <br>
LESLIE: Well, sir, for an agricultural colony, they have actually very
little acreage planted. There's enough to sustain the colony, but very
little more. <br>

when the expedition left Earth. He registered scar tissue on his lungs
from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. No major operations,
but there was an appendectomy. Received all required inoculations, et
cetera. <br>
KIRK: What's so strange about that? <br>
MCCOY: Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago. You
know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Just like
everyone else I've examined here. <br>
KIRK: Instrument malfunction? <br>
MCCOY: No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately
recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It
did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a
healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed. </font></p>

SPOCK: I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct
answer to any question. <br>

in here where no one could come. There was only the face you allow
people to see. Only one side you'd allow them to know. <br>

you understand? <br>

shown that we're all in perfect health. We've had no deaths here. <br>

important is it gives life, peace, love. <br>
SPOCK: What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a
happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not
possible. <br>

quite well. <br>

ELIAS: Captain, why don't you join us? <br>
KIRK: In your own private paradise. <br>
ELIAS: The spores have made it that. <br>
KIRK: Where did they originate? <br>
SPOCK: It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they
finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays.
The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores
until they find a human body to inhabit. <br>
ELIAS: In return, they give you complete health and peace of mind. <br>
KIRK: That's paradise? <br>
ELIAS: We have no need or want, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love. <br>
KIRK: No wants. No needs. We weren't meant for that. None of us. Man
stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is. <br>
ELIAS: We have what we need. <br>
KIRK: Except a challenge. <br>
SPOCK: You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or

KIRK: Captain's log, stardate 3417.7. Except for myself, all crew
personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. Mutinied.
Lieutenant Uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station.
I can only contact the surface of the planet. The ship can be
maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic
controls, I cannot pilot her alone. In effect, I am marooned here. I'm
beginning to realise just how big this ship really is, how quiet. I
don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the
spores. I don't know what I can offer against paradise. <br>

emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've
discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable
risk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.
Aroused, his great physical strength could kill. But it's a risk I'll
have to take.

Energising. <br>
(Spock materialises.) <br>
KIRK: All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed,
we'll see about you deserting my ship. <br>
SPOCK: The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is
inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man. <br>
KIRK: What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown
jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid. <br>
SPOCK: Jim, I don't understand. <br>
KIRK: Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to
understand. All you have is printed circuits. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, if you'll excuse me. <br>
KIRK: What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose
father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia? <br>
SPOCK: My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador. <br>
KIRK: Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a
planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.
<br>
SPOCK: Captain, please don't <br>
KIRK: You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core,
rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to
make love to that girl. <br>
SPOCK: That's enough. <br>
KIRK: Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory
banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself
off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Right next
to the dog-faced boy. <br>
(Spock bends the metal bar with one blow, and throws Kirk around the
transporter
room with ease. Fortunately, Kirk is able to dodge the blows that
damage the walls and equipment until finally...) <br>
KIRK: Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick
hide of yours. Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about. It isn't
every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times. <br>
SPOCK: You did that to me deliberately. <br>
KIRK: Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one. <br>
SPOCK: The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore. <br>
KIRK: You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions
overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough
to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl
with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical. <br>
KIRK: I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic
transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and
broadcast over the communicator? <br>
SPOCK: It can be done. <br>
KIRK: Good. Let's get to work. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence. <br>
KIRK: Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the
subsonic transmitter? <br>

LEILA: I love you. I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop
repeating myself. On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself. You
couldn't even put your arms around me. We couldn't have anything
together there. We couldn't have anything together anyplace else. We're
happy here. (crying) I can't lose you now, Mister Spock. I can't. <br>
SPOCK: I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge.
I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we
all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's. <br>
LEILA: I have lost you, haven't I? And not only you, I've lost all of
it. The spores. I've lost them, too. <br>

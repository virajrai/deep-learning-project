SCOTT: A few seconds after they sent this one up through the
transporter, that duplicate appeared. Except it's not a duplicate, it's
an opposite. Two of the same animal, but different. One gentle, this.

I had to fight you, and scratch your face. <br>
KIRK: Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any

RAND: I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe <br>

SCOTT: I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered
with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. It may have
caused an overload. Can't tell, not yet. <br>
KIRK: Does the transporter work at all? <br>
SCOTT: Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might
be duplicated like this animal. <br>
KIRK: How long will it take you to find the trouble? <br>
SCOTT: Can't say, sir. <br>
KIRK: We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark.
They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a
hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night. <br>
SCOTT: We're doing everything we can, sir. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I know, Scotty. <br>
SPOCK: About your double, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister
Spock. Organise search parties. <br>
SPOCK: We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous
experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. <br>
KIRK: Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed.
The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked,
on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed.
He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be
killed. <br>
SPOCK: How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are
to capture you? <br>
KIRK: Tell them. <br>
SPOCK: The search parties, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what
happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you
can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this
ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.
You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you
do, they lose faith, and you lose command. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I
forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your
orders, your orders are to tell me. <br>

SPOCK: Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the
power of decision. <br>
MCCOY: You have a point, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to
appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms,
the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call
hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people
express as compassion, love, tenderness. <br>
MCCOY: It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that,
Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We
see indications that it's his negative side
which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly
controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative
side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. <br>

unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know.
Animal could have died of some kind of shock. <br>
SPOCK: For once, I agree with you. <br>
MCCOY: I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a
full post-mortem. <br>
SPOCK: No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified,
confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back
together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. <br>
KIRK: Yes, yes, that sounds likely. <br>
SPOCK: It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence
controlling your fear. <br>
KIRK: Get the transporter room ready. <br>
MCCOY: Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why
don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the
transporter circuits again. <br>
KIRK: That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check
everything. <br>
SPOCK: Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? <br>
KIRK: No, I don't think I've for <br>
SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
<br>
KIRK: Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones.
Their lives <br>
MCCOY: Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by
transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway.
Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory! <br>
SPOCK: Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a
human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at
war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because
my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your
intelligence would enable you to survive as well. <br>
KIRK: Help me. Somebody make the decision. <br>
SPOCK: Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? <br>
KIRK: No. No, I'm not. <br>
MCCOY: Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the
autopsy. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk, I have a tie-in with Sulu now. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here.

OTHER KIRK: What are you going to do? <br>
KIRK: Go through the transporter, both of us. <br>

do. <br>
OTHER KIRK: I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad
when this is over. (grabs Kirk and knocks him out)

RAND: Captain, I <br>
KIRK: Yeoman, I owe you an explanation. <br>
RAND: No. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a
duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched
me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to
you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? <br>

the impostor. <br>
MCCOY: No! <br>
OTHER KIRK: McCoy, he's fooled you. <br>
MCCOY: He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him. <br>
OTHER KIRK: Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is. <br>
FARRELL: Mister Spock, which one? What do we do? <br>
SPOCK: We'll let the captain handle this. <br>
OTHER KIRK: I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face.
Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you
to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I know. <br>
OTHER KIRK: You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him.
He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm
captain of the ship! (starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain! This
is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you. <br>
KIRK: Can half a man live? <br>
OTHER KIRK: Take another step, you'll die. <br>
KIRK: Then we'll both die. <br>
OTHER KIRK: Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me.
(Kirk takes phaser off him) I don't want to go back. Please! I want to
live! <br>
KIRK: You will. Both of us. <br>
OTHER KIRK: I want to live!

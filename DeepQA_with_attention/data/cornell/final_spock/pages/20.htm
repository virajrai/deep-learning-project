KIRK: Well, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen
atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises. <br>
KIRK: Photographic section, begin scanning. Tie in to visual section
988-TG, computer bank 22. Kirk out.
About four more orbits ought to do it, Mister Lesley. That'll wrap it
up. Lay in a course for Starbase 200. <br>
LESLEY: Aye, aye, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. <br>
(Something suddenly rocks the ship. We see a shot of a nebula along
with the crew.) <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock! <br>
SPOCK: Incredible, Captain. <br>
(And again.) <br>
KIRK: What was that? <br>
SPOCK: What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain.
Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our
instruments seemed on the verge of winking out. <br>
KIRK: I want facts, not poetry. <br>
SPOCK: I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field
in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of
which we're measuring, attained zero gravity. <br>
KIRK: That's impossible. What you're describing <br>
SPOCK: Is non-existence. <br>
UHURA: Standard General Alert signal from Starfleet Command, Captain. <br>
KIRK: All stations to immediate alert status. Stand by. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface
below. <br>
KIRK: You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago. How are you
just picking it up now? <br>
SPOCK: Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the
moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside. <br>
KIRK: Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup? <br>
SPOCK: A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass,
electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain. <br>
KIRK: And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out? <br>
SPOCK; Almost to the second. <br>
KIRK: Explanation. <br>
SPOCK: None. <br>
KIRK: Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship? <br>
SPOCK: Possible. Very possible. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of
men ready to beam down with us. Let's go. Any word comes through from
Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately. Communications, priority
one.

an uncharted planet, the Enterprise and at least this entire quadrant
of space, has been subjected to violent, unexplained stress and force.
Sensors have reported the presence of a human being on the planet below
who might be connected with the phenomenon. With my first officer and a
security team, I have set out in search of him.

rocky terrain with a few scrubby bushes. They walk on a little way
until they spot a strange craft on the ground. A one-man flying saucer
with a perspex dome cockpit. As they reach it, a man calls out from a
ridge.) <br>
LAZARUS: You came! Thank the heavens. There's still time. It's not too
late. We can still stop him. But I, but I, need, need your help. <br>

MASTERS: (A woman in a blue uniform) Report on the dilithium crystals,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
MASTERS: Whatever that phenomenon was, it drained almost all of our
crystals completely. It could mean trouble. <br>
KIRK: You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full
crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify
immediately. <br>
MASTERS: Aye aye, sir.&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: Any further magnetic disturbance? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal. <br>
KIRK: Nothing? <br>
SPOCK: Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable
by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to
ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was
unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath
us. <br>
KIRK: Keep checking. <br>
UHURA: Red Two message in one minute, Captain. Starfleet Command. Code
Factor one, sir. <br>
KIRK: Repeat. <br>
UHURA: Code Factor one. <br>
KIRK: Invasion status. All hands, this is the Captain. Battle stations.
I repeat, battle stations. This is no drill. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: About our patient. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Doctor, quickly. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: He'll make it. He'll be stiff and sore for a while, but
he'll be all right. <br>
KIRK: I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out. <br>
UHURA: Message ready, Captain. Main screen, coming up. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. Enterprise standing by, Commodore. <br>
BARSTOW [on viewscreen]: You're aware of the effect an hour ago? <br>
KIRK: Yes, sir. <br>
BARSTOW [on viewscreen]: You may not be aware of its scope. It occurred
in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond. Complete disruption of
normal magnetic and gravimetric fields, timewarp distortion, possible
radiation variations. And all of them centring on the general area
which you are now patrolling. The question is, are these natural
phenomena or are they mechanically created, and if they are, by whom?
For what purpose? Your guess, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, sir. I have considered all the alternatives. My best
guess is it could be a prelude to invasion. <br>
BARSTOW [on viewscreen]: Exactly our consensus. I'm giving you the job
of finding out specifically. <br>
KIRK; Aye, aye, sir. Can you assign me other starships as a reserve? <br>
BARSTOW [on viewscreen]: Negative. I'm evacuating all Starfleet units
and personnel within a hundred parsecs of your position. It's going to
be tough on you and the Enterprise, but that's the job you've drawn.
You're on your own. <br>
KIRK: I see. You mean, we're the bait. <br>
BARSTOW [on viewscreen]: Good luck. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, sir. (transmission ends) Maintain alert status at all
battle stations. <br>
UHURA: Aye aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the
planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent. <br>
SPOCK: Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in
order. My job, sir? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest. Maybe he can
provide some answers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAZARUS: That's how I came to be down there,
Captain, pursuing the devil's own spawn, a thing I've chased across the
universe. He's humanoid outside, but inside, he's a hideous, murdering
monster. I'll get him, Captain. I swear it. <br>
KIRK: You say this one man <br>
LAZARUS: Not man! Thing. <br>
KIRK: Thing destroyed your entire civilisation. <br>
LAZARUS: To the last man, woman and child. <br>
KIRK: How did you escape? <br>
LAZARUS: I was inspecting magnetic communications satellites. You
believe me, don't you? <br>
KIRK: Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of
incredible effects. <br>
LAZARUS: That was he! He's death, anti-life, he lives to destroy. <br>
KIRK: Is he the thing that attacked you? <br>
LAZARUS: Yes. I give you my word. I swear it. <br>
KIRK: We don't have any other facts, any information. <br>
LAZARUS: Then you'll join me in my holy cause? Help me in visiting
justice and vengeance upon him. <br>
KIRK: My only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we're on.
You'll beam down with me and I'll check your story out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The flying saucer is being minutely examined) <br>
KIRK: Spock, find anything? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest? <br>
KIRK: According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a
humanoid. <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered
re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on
this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to. <br>
LAZARUS: Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations.
Why do you give credence to this man? <br>
SPOCK: I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the
logical deduction that you are a liar. <br>
KIRK: Let's have it. The truth this time. <br>
(Another one of those 'nebula overlay' events happens, and Lazarus
starts shouting then runs off.)<br>
LAZARUS: No! You've come back in, is it? Well, don't stop. Here I am.
Come at me again. We'll finish it! <br>
KIRK: Can you identify that? <br>
SPOCK: I'm trying, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Lazarus! You stay here. All personnel, security red. <br>
LAZARUS: Come! Come! It'll do you no good. I'll chase you to the very
fires of hell! <br>
(We're treated to a negative image of Lazarus suddenly being pounced on
by another person. They fight as the picture keeps being rotated to
make you dizzy. Then it all ends and Lazarus staggers back on the
planet surface again.)<br>
KIRK: Lazarus, what happened? <br>
LAZARUS: I saw it again. The thing. It attacked me. <br>
KIRK: Let's get out of here. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this
planet, almost on this very spot. <br>
LAZARUS: I told you it was a thing. All white, black and empty. A
terrible emptiness. <br>
KIRK: Let's get back to the ship. <br>
LAZARUS: He'll kill us all if we don't kill him first! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Any luck? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the
second phenomenon than I can the first. <br>
KIRK: If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said <br>
SPOCK: That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an
effect of such magnitude? <br>
KIRK: Hard to believe. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed. <br>
KIRK: But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an
apparent confrontation with something. <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative. <br>
KIRK: Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He
has no weapons, no power. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the
phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his
alleged confrontations. <br>

things, and maybe I'm not. You tell me. <br>
KIRK: You tell me. That's why you brought me down here, isn't it. <br>
MCCOY: Well, as you know, we both brought Lazarus in here and I treated
a deep abrasion on his forehead, right? <br>
KIRK: Right. <br>
MCCOY: Then I bandaged it, I stepped into this room for just a moment <br>
KIRK: Bones, I've got a lot of things to do. Get to the point. <br>
MCCOY: Well, say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative
powers ditto. As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a
miraculous touch. Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of
that wound on his forehead. Not even a bruise. It was like he had never
been injured. <br>

LAZARUS: Yes. But impatient. Have you decided to help me yet? <br>
(McCoy removes the plaster to show the cut.) <br>

KIRK: How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before? <br>
SPOCK: Because it is not there. <br>
KIRK: Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you? <br>
SPOCK: What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning
procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect. <br>
KIRK: But it is there. <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may
be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our
universe. <br>
KIRK: A what? <br>
SPOCK: A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our
established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the
dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it. <br>
LAZARUS: Yes! That's it! The dilithium crystals. With their power we
could do it. <br>
SPOCK: You refer to the humanoid? <br>
LAZARUS: Yes. We've got him, Captain, we've got him. <br>
KIRK: What do the crystals have to do with it? All they show us the
point of radiation. <br>
LAZARUS: That's just it, that's the key. That's the way to trap him.
That's the solution. Captain, I beg of you. I plead, I demand. Give me
the crystals. <br>
KIRK: Out of the question. Those crystals are the very heart of the
power of my ship. <br>
LAZARUS: You fool! There won't be any ship if we don't kill him. He'll
destroy all of you. <br>
KIRK: How? Now you tell me how. All I've heard is double-talk, lies,
threats, accusations that don't hold water. Now you tell me, how it
presents a danger to my ship? <br>

Why, he he can pilot a spaceship. He can compute formulas to destroy
races. He can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape
from me. Are you deaf as well as blind? <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: What have we got, Mister Spock? A magnetic
effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon. A mysterious,
unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking
powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid. <br>
SPOCK: True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our
ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any
object in our universe, be it energy or matter. <br>
KIRK: But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the
source of the radiation on the planet. <br>
SPOCK: Correct. Which would seem to be impossible. <br>
KIRK: Are the instruments in order? <br>
SPOCK: Perfect working condition. <br>
KIRK: Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source
of radiation is not from our universe. <br>
SPOCK: Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside. <br>
KIRK: Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps
in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time. <br>
SPOCK: The possible existence of a parallel universe has been
scientifically conceded, Captain. <br>
KIRK: All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus
universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours? <br>
SPOCK: Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an
immense scale. <br>
KIRK: Which is what we've been experiencing. The point where they come
into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole? <br>
SPOCK: Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple
container can either allow the contents to escape <br>
KIRK: Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow
suspected. <br>
SPOCK: There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion. <br>
KIRK: But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis
of the mental state of Lazarus? <br>
SPOCK: Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild,
rational. Almost as if he were two men. <br>
KIRK: Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the
universe. No, not a hole, A door. <br>
SPOCK: Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass. <br>
KIRK: Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death,
the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull. <br>
SPOCK: The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then
he has it again. <br>
KIRK: Which is physically impossible for one man. <br>
SPOCK: Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him. <br>
KIRK: What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This
wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's
the purpose? <br>
SPOCK: Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal.
He must be stopped, held. Destroyed if necessary. <br>
KIRK: I don't follow you. <br>
SPOCK: Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other
negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter. <br>
KIRK: Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a
tendency to cancel each other out. violently. <br>
SPOCK: Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical
particles of matter and antimatter meet <br>
KIRK: Like Lazarus. Identical. Like both Lazarus', only one is matter
and the other antimatter. If they meet. <br>
SPOCK: Annihilation, Jim. Total, complete, absolute annihilation. <br>
KIRK: Of everything that exists, everywhere. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAZARUS: It's done, it's done! Finished, finished.
It's done. It's done. It's done, it's done. <br>
KIRK: Lazarus. <br>
LAZARUS: Done. No! Don't! Not you! <br>
(Kirk leans into the saucer - and vanishes.) <br>
LAZARUS: No! <br>
(Kirk goes into that negative space and finds that there is nowhere to
run to. Then suddenly he's on the ground on the planet again. Or is he?
He walks over to the saucer and is greeted by uninjured Lazarus.) <br>
LAZARUS: Welcome, Captain. I wasn't expecting you. <br>
KIRK: No, him. <br>
LAZARUS: Yes, him. You understand. <br>
KIRK: Not completely. This is a parallel universe? <br>
LAZARUS: Of course. <br>
KIRK: Antimatter? <br>
LAZARUS: Here, yes. <br>
KIRK: And if identical particles meet <br>
LAZARUS: The end of everything. Civilisation, existence, all gone. I
tried to stop him, Captain. That's why I took your dilithium crystals. <br>
KIRK: He has two more. <br>
LAZARUS: That's very bad, Captain. If he comes through at a time of his
own choosing. But I think if we hurry and you will help me, he can yet
still be stopped. There's little time left. He meant to come through.
When you accidentally passed through, it drained his crystals. It'll
take him about ten minutes to re-energise with the equipment aboard his
ship. That should give us enough time. <br>
KIRK: Exactly what did I pass through? <br>
LAZARUS: That's hard to explain, Captain. I call it an alternative
warp. It's sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel
universes meet. It's sort of a safety valve. It keeps eternity from
blowing up. <br>
KIRK: This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking
out phenomenon? <br>
LAZARUS: Precisely, Captain, but not because of its existence. Because,
because my foe entered. The corridor is like a prison, with explosives
at the door. Open the door, and the explosives might go off. Stay
inside <br>
KIRK: And the universe is safe. <br>
LAZARUS: Both universes, Captain. Yours and mine. <br>
KIRK: Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet
face to face outside the corridor. <br>
LAZARUS: Of course he knows, Captain, but he's mad. You heard him. He's
lost his mind. When our people found a way to slip through the warp and
prove another universe, an identical one, existed, it was too much for
him.
He could not live knowing that I lived. He became obsessed with the
idea of destroying me. The fact that it meant his own destruction, and
everything else, meant nothing to him. <br>
KIRK: So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The
creature. <br>
LAZARUS: Yes, Captain. Or he is. It depends on your point of view,
doesn't it? It's ready, Captain. If we can force him into the corridor
while I'm waiting for him, we can put an end to this. But if he comes
through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to
find me <br>
KIRK: I understand. What do you want me to do? <br>
LAZARUS: Find him. Force him through his threshold, while I'm waiting
for him, into the corridor, and I'll hold him there. <br>
KIRK: You can't hold him forever. <br>
LAZARUS: Can't I, Captain? You destroy his ship. <br>
KIRK: If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed? <br>
LAZARUS: It will. <br>
KIRK: And your door will be closed. <br>
LAZARUS: Yes, and so will his. <br>
KIRK: You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever. At each
other's throats throughout time. <br>
LAZARUS: Is it such a large price to pay for the safety of two
universes? <br>
KIRK: I'm ready. <br>
LAZARUS: Send him to me. I'll be waiting. <br>
(Lazarus activates his crystals manually, and Kirk vanishes, then
reappears on 'our' planet and gestures to Spock who has come down with
two guards.) <br>
SPOCK: Lazarus. <br>
(Kirk jumps him while he is distracted and knocks him down.)<br>
KIRK: Stand back. <br>
(But Lazarus has him in a bear hug, and they struggle together for a
while until Kirk finally gets the upper-hand again.) <br>
LAZARUS: No! No! No, I'm not ready! I'm not ready! <br>
(Kirk throws him through the threshold.) <br>
SPOCK: Take these crystals to the Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: I must destroy that ship completely. <br>
SPOCK: What of Lazarus? <br>
KIRK: And what of Lazarus? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Activate phaser banks. <br>

LESLEY: Phasers standing by, sir. <br>
KIRK: Fire phasers. <br>
(A sustained burst hits the little saucer, while the two Lazarus'
wrestle in non-space. Finally it disappears.) <br>
KIRK: All right, Mister Lesley, let's get out of here. Ahead warp
factor one. <br>
LESLEY: Warp one, sir. <br>
KIRK: Everything's all right, Mister Spock, for us. <br>
SPOCK: There is, of course, no escape for them, sir. <br>
KIRK: There is, of course, no escape. How would it be? Trapped forever
with a raging madman at your throat until time itself came to a stop?
For eternity. How would it be? <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the universe is safe. <br>
KIRK: For you and me. But what of Lazarus? What of Lazarus? </font>

SULU: Phaser banks standing by, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: Range forty three thousand and closing. <br>
KIRK: What do you read, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity,
though of a unique technology. <br>
KIRK: Any contact, Lieutenant? <br>
UHURA: Hailing on all frequencies, sir. All languages have been
attempted. No response. Now using standard interstellar symbols. <br>
KIRK: Keep trying. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Magnification ten, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, sir. Thirty eight thousand and closing. <br>
KIRK: Well, Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: It beats me, but isn't she a beauty? <br>
KIRK: Interesting design. <br>
SCOTT: I've never seen anything like her. And ion propulsion at that.
They could teach us a thing or two. <br>
KIRK: Life forms, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support
systems functioning. Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen.
Instruments indicate a transferal beam emanating from the area of the
humanoid life form. <br>
KIRK: Directed at what? <br>
SPOCK: Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Security guard. <br>
UHURA: Security guard to the Bridge. <br>
(A woman materialises and smiles at them.) <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk. This is the Starship Enterprise. <br>
(The security guards rush in, she presses a button on her wrist band,
the power goes off and everyone collapses. Then the same happens to the
crew all over the ship. The woman walks over to Spock, and puts her
hand on his head.) <br>
(Later - after the opening titles - the power comes back on and
everyone wakes up again.) <br>
SULU: What happened? <br>
KIRK: Helm status, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: No change from last reading, sir. <br>
KIRK: Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Spock. Where's Spock? <br>
MCCOY [OC]: Jim! Jim! <br>
KIRK: Yes, what is it? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[McCoy's office]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

his head and life-support equipment over his torso.) <br>
MCCOY: Now. <br>
CHAPEL: Functioning. <br>
MCCOY: Thank God. <br>
KIRK: Spock. What happened? <br>
CHAPEL: I found him on the table. <br>
KIRK: Like this? <br>
MCCOY: No, not like this. <br>
KIRK: What happened? <br>
MCCOY: I don't know. <br>
KIRK: You've got him on complete life support. Was he dead? <br>
MCCOY: He was worse than dead. <br>
KIRK: What do you mean? <br>
MCCOY: Jim. <br>
KIRK: Come on, Bones. What's the mystery? <br>
MCCOY: His brain is gone. <br>
KIRK: His what? <br>
MCCOY: It's been removed surgically. <br>
KIRK: How could he survive? <br>
MCCOY: It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen. Every nerve
ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing
torn, no bleeding. It's a medical miracle. <br>
KIRK: If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying. <br>
MCCOY: No. That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the
life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions
continue. But there is no mind. <br>
KIRK: That girl. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
MCCOY: What girl? <br>
KIRK: From that ship. She took it. I don't know why, or where, but she
must have taken it. Bones, how long can you keep him functioning? <br>
MCCOY: I can't give you any guarantee. <br>
KIRK: That's not good enough, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely. But Vulcan
physiology limits what I can do. Spock's body is more dependent on that
tremendous brain for life support. <br>
KIRK: Then we'll take him with us. <br>
MCCOY: Take him? Take him where? <br>
KIRK: In search of his brain, Doctor. From what you say, the moment we
find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where
are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it? <br>
KIRK: I'll find it. <br>
MCCOY: Even if you do, I can't restore it. I don't have the medical
technique. <br>
KIRK: It was taken out. It can be put back in. <br>
MCCOY: But I don't know how. <br>
KIRK: The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of
her. <br>
MCCOY: If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget
the whole thing, Jim. <br>
KIRK: You and Scotty have Spock ready.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SULU: I've got it again. An ion trail matching when
we first saw her. <br>
KIRK: Where does the trail lead to? <br>
CHEKOV: System Sigma Draconis. <br>
KIRK: Lock on, Mister Sulu. Maximum speed. <br>
SULU: Warp six. <br>
KIRK: No question about the trail? <br>
SULU: No mistake, sir.

KIRK: All scanners, extreme sweep. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Well? <br>
CHEKOV: Nothing, sir. <br>
UHURA: No signal at all, Captain. <br>
SULU: It's gone, sir. A sudden deaction shift. <br>
KIRK: We've lost her trail, but she went into that system. Mister
Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Read out, Mister Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: Sun, spectral type, Gamma nine. Nine planets, three of them,
Class M possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range
scanning. <br>
KIRK: She was breathing our air. She must've gone to one of them. Show
us the three Class-M planets. Mister Chekov. <br>
(Chekov gets up and goes to the viewscreen to point out the relevant
items.) <br>
CHEKOV: The one on the left, number three, rates letter B on the
industrial scale. <br>
KIRK: Earth equivalent approximately 1485. <br>
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. Second planet Class M, number four, rates letter G. <br>
KIRK: The year 2030. <br>
SULU: But that ship, Captain, either it was many years ahead of us or
the most incredible design fluke in history. <br>
KIRK: Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: Number six. No sign of industrial development. At last report,
in a Glacial Age. Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive
level. <br>
KIRK: Now. as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M
planets, <br>
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight, <br>
CHEKOV: No, sir. <br>
KIRK: Yet one of them accomplished it. <br>
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. <br>
UHURA: Captain, I'm picking up high energy generation on planet six. <br>
KIRK: That's the primitive glaciated planet. <br>
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: The source of it? <br>
UHURA: It could be natural. Volcanic activity, steam, any number of
causes. But it's very regular. <br>
KIRK: What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: No sign of organised civilisation. Primitive humanoids picked
up at irregular intervals. <br>
KIRK: With regular pulsations of generated energy? <br>
CHEKOV: I can't explain it, sir. <br>
KIRK: I can't afford to guess wrong. I've got to choose the right
planet, get there, find the brain. Eight hours and thirty five minutes.
<br>
KIRK: Recommendations, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: Sigma Draconis Three. It's closest, heaviest population. <br>
SULU: But a technological rating of only three. They couldn't possibly
have put that ship we saw into space. <br>
CHEKOV: None of these planets could. <br>
SULU: I say planet four, Captain. At least planet four is ahead of
three technologically. <br>
KIRK: But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities. It'd
be a miracle if they had developed it. <br>
UHURA: What would they want with his brain? What would they want with
Mister Spock's brain? What use is it? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
UHURA: Why do they want it? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Why would they want it? Eight hours and thirty four minutes.
Planet six is glaciated, you say? <br>
CHEKOV: Several thousand years at least. Only the tropical zone is
ice-free. <br>
KIRK: But the energy. Regular. It's there. It's real. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. It doesn't make sense, but it's there. <br>
KIRK: Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party
down to planet six. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SULU: A hunch, Captain? <br>
KIRK: A hunch, Mister Sulu. <br>
CHEKOV: What if you guess wrong, Captain? <br>
KIRK: If I guess wrong, Mister Spock is dead. Spock will die.

Spock? (gets a look) Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: Scattered. Widely spaced. Humanoid, all right. On the large
side. <br>
KIRK: Watch out. We know their development is primitive. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
KIRK: Read out, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: No structures, Captain. No mechanised objects that I can read.
No surface consumption or generation of energy. Atmosphere is perfectly
all right, of course. Temperature, a high maximum of forty. Livable. <br>
KIRK: You have a thick skin. <br>
SCOTT: Captain! There's someone, something out there in the rocks. Five
of them. Humanoid, large. <br>
KIRK: Phasers on stun. I want them conscious. <br>
(The group of bearded, skin clad males with clubs move carefully
towards the Starfleet party.) <br>
KIRK: Fire only on my signal. Flank out. <br>
(The primitives suddenly leap up from behind rocks, throwing stones and
their clubs. Kirk fires, and stuns the leader. The rest run away.) <br>
KIRK: We mean you no harm. We're not your enemies, we're your friends.
We only wish to talk to you. <br>
MORG: You are not the Others? <br>
KIRK: No. We come from a far place. We are men. <br>
MORG: Men? <br>
KIRK: Like yourselves. <br>
MORG: You are small, like the Others. <br>
KIRK: Who are the Others? <br>
MORG: Givers of pain and delight. <br>
KIRK: Do they live here with you? <br>
MORG: No. They come. They give pain and delight. <br>
KIRK: Do they come from the sky? <br>
MORG: They are here. You will see. The Others will come for you. They
come for all like us. <br>
KIRK: Do they come for your women as well? <br>
MORG: Women? <br>
KIRK: The female of your kind. <br>
MORG: Your words say nothing. <br>
KIRK: Don't you have a mate? <br>
MORG: Mate? <br>
SCOTT: A companion. <br>
KIRK: Will you take us where we can find the Others? <br>
MORG: (afraid) No one wants to find them. <br>
KIRK: We do. We want to find them. Take us there and we'll let you go. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, five hundred metres in that direction there's a
foundation under the surface. A huge one. Registrations all over the
place. <br>
KIRK: Buildings? <br>
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. Immensely old, completely buried. But they were here
once. <br>
KIRK: Somewhere down there is where the Others live. Scotty, see if you
can find a way down. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>
MORG: No! No! No, do not go there! No! No! <br>
KIRK: It's all right. <br>
(He struggles briefly with the Morg, who escapes and runs off.) <br>
KIRK: It's all right. Let him go. <br>
CHEKOV: What could the Others do to cause such terror? <br>
KIRK: What was it he said, pain and delight? <br>
CHEKOV: A peculiar mixture. <br>
KIRK: A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age. <br>
CHEKOV: And the male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word
female. <br>

What do you think? <br>
SCOTT: It could be a warning device to keep those creatures away from
the food. <br>
KIRK: Or the food could be a lure set by the Others to bring them in
here. <br>
SCOTT: In that case, the beam would be a signal. <br>

KIRK: How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've
met? <br>
(Their equipment is laid out on a table, but another Morg stops Kirk
getting to it.) <br>
SCOTT: Those women could never have set up anything as complex as this
has to be. Why, that takes engineering genius. But there's no sign of
engineering genius in any of those women. <br>
KIRK: They were smart enough to invent these training devices. What a
way to maintain control over a man. <br>
SCOTT: Pain and delight, he said up above. <br>
MCCOY: I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects. But that
too was strictly under command of the women. <br>
SCOTT: How does Spock's brain fit into this? <br>
KIRK: With a communicator, we might be able to find out. This fellow is
keeping us from our property. <br>
SCOTT: Isn't there a way to correct that situation? <br>
KIRK: I certainly think that science might provide an answer. <br>
MCCOY: It does, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Agreed, Doctor. <br>
(Kirk hits the Morg by the table while Scott and McCoy take on the one
by the door. It isn't easy, but finally the Captain triumphs.) <br>
KIRK: Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones, give them something
to keep them out for a while. (into communicator) Spock. Spock. Come
on, Spock. Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, Captain, I am still here. Have you returned to the
Enterprise? <br>
KIRK: No. We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of
what they were using you for. Is it medical? <br>
SPOCK [OC]: I am not certain. I seem to have a body which stretches
into infinity. <br>
SCOTT: Body? Why, you have none. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Then what am l? <br>
MCCOY: You are a disembodied brain. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Fascinating. It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla
oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping
blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature. <br>
KIRK: Spock, we don't have time for that. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Why are you endangering your lives by coming here? <br>
KIRK: We came to put you back. Where are you? <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Back where? <br>
KIRK: Back into your body. We brought it along with us. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I
might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not
believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain. <br>
MCCOY: Thank you. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy. That skill does not
yet exist in the galaxy. <br>
KIRK: The skill to remove it exists right where we are. Restoring it
must also be possible. That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as
we can. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my
behalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a
reasonable chance for success. Let me ask you, how much time has
elapsed since <br>
KIRK: Eighteen hours and twelve minutes. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Doctor McCoy must've told you that twenty four hours is the
maximum my body can <br>
MCCOY: I told him. <br>
KIRK: That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock.
<br>
SPOCK [OC]: It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills,
does it not? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately. Beam
us a signal so we can home in on you. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. <br>
SCOTT: Got it. <br>
KIRK: Bones. (Spock's body stands up and they walk out of the room) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Oh, Spock, one question. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: We've got pain-giving devices attached to us. Can you tell us how
to get them off. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: I shall give it top priority. <br>
(They walk along.) <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands
are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I
know that does not make much sense. <br>
KIRK: Oh, yes it does, Spock. (further along) Keep concentrating,
Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock. <br>
SCOTT: Must be in there, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Control Room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kara is in there, with her back to the door. She
hears them enter, and gives them pain.) <br>
MCCOY: Jim.. Spock. No pain. <br>
(Kirk manages to get to the control box that McCoy dropped and get
Spock's body to walk over to Kara.) <br>
KARA: No. Go away. <br>
(Spock holds her wrists, then finally presses the red button. The belts
fly off.) <br>
KARA: We will die. You must not take the Controller away. We will all
die. The Controller is young and powerful. Perfect! <br>
SPOCK [OC]: How very flattering. <br>
KARA: You will give life to my people for ten thousand years to come. <br>
KIRK: You'll find another Controller. <br>
KARA: The old one is finished! There is no other than this and will not
be another for ten thousand years. <br>
KIRK: Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a
complex control panel. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature?
Is it possible that you're
re-circulating air,
running heating plants, purifying water? <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Indeed, Captain. That is unquestionably part of what I am
doing. <br>
KARA: He must stay. He must stay! <br>
KIRK: He will not stay. (He makes Spock release her, and grabs her
himself, taking off her bracelet.) Now, you took his brain. You will
put it back. How did you do it? <br>
KARA: I do not know. <br>
MCCOY: She couldn't, Jim. Her mind is functioning on a very simple
level. Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of
non-use. <br>
KIRK: She was on the Enterprise. She must have done it. How did you do
it? <br>
KARA: It was the old knowledge. <br>
KIRK: How do you get the old knowledge? <br>
KARA: I put upon my head the Teacher. <br>
KIRK: What is the Teacher? <br>
KARA: The great Teacher of all the ancient knowledge. <br>
(There is a transparent helmet with what look like a whole lot of
syringes sticking through it.) <br>
SPOCK [OC]: If I may explain, Captain. She refers to the tape
storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place. I scan it. A
most impressive store. <br>
KIRK: How does it work? Show us. <br>
KARA; I cannot. <br>
KIRK: You must tell us. <br>
KARA: I cannot. Only by command of the ancients may I understand. <br>
KIRK: How does it work? Show us! We'll protect you. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: It is a device with feeding circuits. They lead into the
mind of the priestess leader. Its use is strictly predetermined by the
builders. <br>
(Kirk forces her into the helmet.) <br>
KARA: No! The knowledge is forbidden! I must not know the secret! I
will be punished! <br>
(A control panel comes on and she goes quiet.) <br>
KARA: (confident, assured) Gentlemen, the Controller's explanation of
the functioning of the Teacher is essentially correct. However, he is
giving no credit to me. I provide the means whereby the knowledge is
used. Without me, Captain <br>
MCCOY: Without you there could be no delicate miracle that kept Spock's
brain alive. <br>
KARA: Thank you, Doctor. That was very gracious. <br>
MCCOY: Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability. <br>
KARA: Good, Captain Kirk. Then you also appreciate that without the
Teacher, I would not have the knowledge to use that which you have
thoughtfully provided. <br>
(She points a phaser at him.) <br>
SCOTT: That phaser is set to kill. <br>
KARA: So it is. That is the knowledge you have brought me. Do not move.
If your weapon kills, it will kill you. <br>
KIRK: We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing. If you
continue, you'll kill Spock. <br>
KARA: The Controller die? The Controller will live for ten thousand
years, and we shall give him all our devotion. <br>
KIRK: But Spock will be dead. His body's dying this minute. <br>
KARA: Why do you not understand that the need of my people for their
Controller is greater than your need for your friend. <br>
KIRK: No one may kill a man. Not for any purpose. It cannot be
condoned. <br>
(He reaches for the phaser.) <br>
KARA: Do not! I do not know killing. I do not wish to kill. <br>
(Scott groans and faints, distracting her so Kirk can grab the phaser.)
<br>
KARA: The commandment must be fulfilled. <br>
KIRK: You must help us. When you came to the ship, you had the
knowledge. Yet, when we came here, you didn't. <br>
KARA: Correct. <br>
KIRK: How long does the knowledge last? <br>
KARA: Three of your hours. <br>
MCCOY: It would be just enough time. <br>
KIRK: If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken? <br>
KARA: I would not. <br>
KIRK: You must help us. You must restore with that knowledge what you
have taken. <br>
KARA: No! <br>
KIRK: You must put back what you have taken. <br>
KARA: I will not betray my people. The Controller will stay. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, it worked for her. It might work for me. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: She is an alien. The configurations of her brain are
different. It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain,
Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: I'm a surgeon already. If I could learn these techniques, I
might be able to retain them. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, you might lose the doctor that way. <br>
MCCOY: He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, didn't you hear? I might be able to retain and bring
these techniques to the world. Jim, isn't it worth that risk? Wouldn't
you insist upon taking such a risk yourself? <br>
KIRK: Go ahead, Doctor. Put the Teacher on. <br>
KARA: No! <br>
(McCoy goes over to the device, and Kirk adjusts it onto his head.
McCoy winces in pain as knowledge is fed into his brain, then falls to
his knees.) <br>
MCCOY: Of course. Of course. A child could do it. A child could do it.

It would kill my medical officer.

SCOTT: I've never seen anything like it. He's operating at warp speed.
I'd like a try at that teacher myself. <br>
KARA: You will have him back and we will be destroyed. <br>
KIRK: No. You won't be destroyed. You'll be without your Controller for
the first time, but you'll be much better off, I think. <br>
KARA: We will die. <br>
KIRK: No, you'll live and develop as you should have. All this
shouldn't have been done for you. Now the women here below and the men
here above will control together. <br>
KARA: They will not help us without the pain. <br>
KIRK: There are other ways. You'll discover them. You must move to the
surface, you understand. <br>
KARA: We will die above in the cold. <br>
KIRK: No, you won't. You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to
work. We'll help you for a while. Humans have survived under worse
conditions. It's a matter of evolution. You'll be fine. <br>

SCOTT: Captain Kirk! <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SCOTT: He's forgetting. <br>
MCCOY: I can't. I <br>
KIRK: Bones? Bones? <br>
MCCOY: All the ganglia, the nerves. There are a million of them. What
am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? <br>
KIRK: Bones, you can't stop now. <br>
MCCOY: I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer. What am I
supposed to do? I can't remember. I don't remember. <br>
KIRK: Bones? <br>
MCCOY: No one can restore a brain. <br>
KIRK: You could. A while ago it was child's play.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Our race against time
to save Spock's life may prove futile. Doctor McCoy has lost the
surgical knowledge he obtained from the teacher. He has been drawing on
his own skills and surgical techniques
in an attempt to continue the operation, but he is faltering and
uncertain. In a desperate hope that he can draw on Spock's brain for
assistance, I instructed Doctor McCoy to give priority to connecting
Spock's vocal chords.

voice) That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator. <br>

SPOCK: Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please
stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by
one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will
then seal using the tri-laser connector. <br>

remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced
beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive
level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a
glacial age reoccurred. This underground complex was developed for the

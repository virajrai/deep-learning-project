Captain's log, stardate 5843.7. The Enterprise is in the grip of a
raging epidemic. Three crewmen have died and twenty three others have
been struck down by Rigelian fever. In order to combat the illness,
Doctor McCoy needs large quantities of ryetalyn,
which is the only known antidote for the fever. Our sensors have picked
up sufficient quantities of pure ryetalyn on a small planet in the
Omega system. We are beaming down to secure this urgently needed
material.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Compared to the lurid red, purple and vivid blue
of the planet from space, the ground is pretty normal) <br>
KIRK: Report. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four
kilometres away. I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise
the epidemic will be irreversible. Everybody on board the Enterprise
will <br>
SPOCK: Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity,
apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was
uninhabited. <br>
KIRK: Let's get that ryetalyn. <br>
(A strange device comes travelling through the air towards them. A bit
like Nomad, but much smaller and with more round bits. It fires an
energy beam at the landing party's feet. They try to fire their
phasers.) <br>
KIRK: Inoperative. <br>
(The device fires again, and closes in.) <br>
FLINT: Do not kill. <br>
(The device backs away and a silver-haired man in sort of doublet and
hose approaches) <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk <br>
FLINT: I know who you are. I have monitored your ship since it entered
this system. <br>
KIRK: Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister? <br>
FLINT: Flint. You will leave my planet. <br>
SPOCK: Did you say your planet, sir? <br>
FLINT: My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth, and the
company of people. <br>
KIRK: Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly
reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn. <br>
FLINT: You're trespassing, Captain. <br>
KIRK: We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it. <br>
FLINT: You have nothing I want. <br>
KIRK: But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take
it. <br>
FLINT: If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you
to leave or kill you where you stand. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our
co-ordinates. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain, all phasers locked on. <br>
KIRK: Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my
crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn. <br>
FLINT: An interesting test of power. Your enormous forces against mine.
Who would win? <br>
SPOCK: Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you
refrain from a most useless experiment. <br>
KIRK: We need only a few hours. <br>
MCCOY: Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one
day. The effects are like bubonic plague. <br>
FLINT: Constantinople, summer 1334. It marched through the streets, the
sewers. It left the city by ox cart, by sea, to kill half of Europe.
The rats, rustling and squealing in the night as they, too, died. The
rats. <br>
SPOCK: Are you a student of history, sir? <br>
FLINT: I am. The Enterprise, a plague ship. You have two hours, at the
end of which time you will leave. <br>
KIRK: With all due gratitude. <br>
FLINT: M4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need. (the device leaves)
Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings. </font></p>

woven rugs, paintings on the wall) <br>
FLINT: Come in, gentlemen. <br>
Our ship's sensors did not reveal your presence here, Mister Flint. <br>
FLINT: My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression
of lifelessness. A protection against the curious, the uninvited. <br>
SPOCK: Then you live here alone. <br>
FLINT: Except for M4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and
guardian. <br>
KIRK: A most impressive home, Mister Flint. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible. </font></p>

That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning

FLINT [on monitor]: Be comfortable, gentlemen. Help yourselves to

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Do we trust him? <br>
SPOCK: It would seem logical to do so for the moment. <br>
MCCOY: Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into
antitoxin. <br>
KIRK: If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting,
right over Mister Flint if necessary. <br>
SPOCK: This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever
seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da
Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th
century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. </font></p>

FLINT: Other men. <br>
RAYNA: One is not human. <br>
FLINT: The Vulcan. <br>
RAYNA: Oh, so that is a Vulcan. I would like to discuss sub-dimensional
physics with him. You've taught me all you know in the area and you say
Vulcans know more. <br>
FLINT: Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine. <br>
RAYNA: Let me meet them. <br>
FLINT: They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community which I
rejected and from which I've shielded you. <br>
RAYNA: Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them. <br>
FLINT: Rayna. (nearly kisses her) Have you been lonely? <br>
RAYNA: What is loneliness? <br>
FLINT: It is thirst. It is a flower dying in the desert. <br>
RAYNA: Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me. It's so
exciting. <br>
FLINT: Exciting? You have never made a demand of me before. <br>
RAYNA: I'm sorry. <br>
FLINT: Do not be sorry. It might be interesting. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim? <br>
KIRK: Please. <br>
MCCOY: Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those
mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human
vice. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy. <br>
MCCOY: Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once
alcohol hits that green blood <br>
SPOCK: If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am
close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion. <br>
MCCOY: I'll drink to that. What emotion? <br>
SPOCK: Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued
or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the
last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci’s,
they would be priceless. <br>
KIRK: Would be? You mean you think they're fakes? <br>
SPOCK: Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable
taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates
that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin. <br>
KIRK: Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover,
a setup, or even an illusion. <br>
MCCOY: Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real
thing. <br>
KIRK: Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder
reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister
Scott? <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on
this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll
contact. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real. <br>
(M4 glides in with a bag of purple crystals and puts it on the table.
It leaves) <br>
KIRK: Easy. Bones? <br>
MCCOY: Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin. <br>
KIRK: Beam up to the ship and start processing. <br>
FLINT: That will not be necessary, Captain. M4 can prepare the ryetalyn
for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard
your ship. <br>
MCCOY: I would like to supervise that, of course. <br>
FLINT: And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do
me the honour of being my guests at dinner. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time. <br>
FLINT: I regret my earlier inhospitality. Let me make amends. <br>
(Rayna enters, and that thud you hear is Kirk's jaw hitting the floor) <br>
FLINT: Gentlemen, may I present Rayna. <br>
KIRK: I thought you lived alone. <br>
FLINT: I meant there are no others besides my family. Doctor McCoy.
Mister Spock. <br>
RAYNA: Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field
density and its relationship to gravity phenomena. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of
mine. <br>
FLINT: Captain Kirk. <br>
RAYNA: Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Rayna. <br>
FLINT: Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ.
Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody. I
have raised and educated her. <br>
MCCOY: With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you
besides gravity phenomena, Rayna? <br>
RAYNA: Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect. <br>
MCCOY: The totality of the universe? All knowledge? <br>
FLINT: Rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees
in the sciences and arts. She is aware that the intellect is not all.
But its cultivation must come first or the individual makes errors,
wastes time in unprofitable pursuits. <br>
MCCOY: At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage,
but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever
seen. <br>
RAYNA: Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen. <br>
MCCOY: The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege. <br>
FLINT: If you would accompany my robot to the laboratory, Doctor, you
can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed. <br>
MCCOY: Thank you, sir. <br>
(McCoy and M4 leave) <br>
FLINT: Your pleasure, gentlemen. Chess, billiards, conversation? <br>
KIRK: Why not all three? <br>
(M4 leads McCoy into a lab, then disappears through a door. McCoy
examines the large coloured jars on a table whilst M4 works behind an
opaque window) <br>
(Rayna sends the cue ball around all four cushions to hit both reds.
Billiards) <br>
KIRK: Did you teach her that? <br>
FLINT: We play often. <br>
RAYNA: May I show you, Captain? <br>
KIRK: You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the
last time you visited Earth? <br>
FLINT: You would tell me that it is no longer cruel. But it is,
Captain. Look at your starship, bristling with weapons.
Its mission to colonise, exploit, destroy, if necessary, to advance
Federation causes. <br>
(Rayna guides Kirk's shot, but he misses anyway) <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If
we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your
greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence. <br>
FLINT: The result of pressures which are not your concern. <br>
KIRK: Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him
to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and
mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it
is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness
from within and from without. <br>
(While Rayna is very close to Kirk, Spock is at a gold carved grand
piano) <br>
FLINT: Why don't you play the waltz, Mister Spock? To be human is also
to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance. Rayna is a most accomplished
dancer. <br>
KIRK: May I have the pleasure? <br>
(So the couple do an old-fashioned waltz as Spock plays) <br>
(In the lab, M4 brings three vials to McCoy for analysis) <br>
(Kirk and Rayna are now literally cheek to cheek. Flint is watching her
carefully)<br>
(McCoy enters)<br>
KIRK: Is something wrong? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It
contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand. <br>
SPOCK: Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless. <br>
FLINT: Most unfortunate that it was not detected. I shall go with M4 to
gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself. You're welcome to join me,
Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Thank you. <br>
(Flint leaves) <br>
KIRK: Time factor, Bones? Epidemic? <br>
MCCOY: Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in
under the wire. I’ve never seen anything like the speed of that robot.
It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff. <br>
KIRK: But would we have made the error? <br>
MCCOY: Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium? <br>
KIRK: Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures. <br>
MCCOY: Like a hawk. <br>
(McCoy leaves) <br>
SPOCK: Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This
waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms. <br>
KIRK: Later, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in
Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely
the work of Brahms, and yet unknown. <br>
KIRK: I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of
reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay
here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.

KIRK: You left us. The room became lonely. <br>
RAYNA: It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert. <br>
KIRK: What? What's in there? <br>
RAYNA: I do not know. Flint told me never to enter. He denies me
nothing else. <br>
KIRK: Then why are you here? <br>
RAYNA: I do not know. I come here when I am troubled, when I would
search myself. <br>
KIRK: Are you troubled now? <br>
RAYNA: Yes. <br>
KIRK: By what? Are you happy here with Flint? <br>
RAYNA: He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FLINT: M4 was programmed to defend this household
and its members. No doubt I should have altered its instructions to
allow for unauthorised but predictable actions on your part. It thought
you were attacking Rayna. A misinterpretation. <br>
KIRK: If it were around right now, it would correct <br>
(M4 enters) <br>
FLINT: Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another. It
will now go to the laboratory and join Doctor McCoy. <br>
(M4 leaves) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
FLINT: Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain. I might have
accepted battle, and I have twice your physical strength. <br>
KIRK: In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power. <br>
FLINT: How childish he is, Rayna. Would you call him brave or a fool? <br>
RAYNA: I'm glad he did not die. <br>
FLINT: Of course! Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing. Doctor
McCoy's in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn. He's satisfied as to
its quality. May I suggest that you wait here patiently, safely. You
have seen that my defence systems operate automatically and not always
in accordance with my wishes. Come, Rayna. Rayna! Come. <br>
(Rayna reluctantly tears herself away from Kirk, and they both leave) <br>
KIRK: I don't like the way he orders her around. <br>
SPOCK: Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn,
Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the
young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do
not appear to be confined to art and science. <br>
KIRK: He loves her? <br>
SPOCK: Strongly indicated. <br>
KIRK: Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to
want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance. <br>

SPOCK: We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a
tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain
biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are
disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order
of six thousand years. <br>

SPOCK: I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical
computer when we return to the ship. <br>

modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings. <br>
FLINT: I am Brahms. <br>
SPOCK: And da Vinci? <br>
FLINT: Yes. <br>
SPOCK: How many other names shall we call you? <br>
FLINT: Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson. A
hundred other names you do not know. <br>
SPOCK: You were born? <br>
FLINT: In that region of earth later called Mesopotamia, in the year
3834 BC, as the millennia are reckoned. I was Akharin, a soldier, a
bully and a fool. I fell in battle, pierced to the heart and did not
die. <br>
MCCOY: Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of
biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and <br>
FLINT: And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to
age and then move on before my nature was suspected. <br>
SPOCK: Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of
acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history. <br>
FLINT: Galileo, Socrates, Moses. I have married a hundred times,
Captain. Selected, loved, cherished. Caressed a smoothness, inhaled a
brief fragrance. Then age, death, the taste of dust. Do you understand?
<br>
SPOCK: You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal
as yourself. Your mate for all time. <br>
FLINT: Designed by my heart. I could not love her more. <br>
KIRK: Spock, you knew? <br>
SPOCK: I had hoped I was wrong. <br>
FLINT: You cannot love an android, Captain. I love her. She is my
handiwork, my property. She is what I desire. <br>
KIRK:: You brought me here to learn this? Does she know? <br>
FLINT: She will never know. <br>
KIRK: Let's go. <br>
FLINT: You will stay. <br>
KIRK: Why? <br>
SPOCK: We have discovered what he is, Captain. <br>
FLINT: If you leave, the curious would follow, the foolish, the
meddlers, the officials, the seekers. My privacy was my own. Its
invasion be on your head. <br>
SPOCK: We can remain silent. <br>
FLINT: The disaster of intervention, Spock. I've known it. I will not
risk it. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
(We see Flint press a button, and the Enterprise disappear from its
orbit) <br>
KIRK: Clear out of the area. Inform Starfleet Command. Enterprise?
Scotty? <br>
FLINT: They cannot answer, Captain. <br>
(A model Enterprise appears on a table. Kirk peers in through the
viewscreen to see everyone stationary) <br>
KIRK: My crew. <br>
FLINT: The test of power. You had no chance. It is time for you to join
your crew. <br>
KIRK: You'd wipe out four hundred lives? Why? <br>
FLINT: I have seen a hundred billion fall. I know death better than any
man. I have tossed enemies into his grasp. And I know mercy. Your crew
is not dead, but suspended. <br>
KIRK: Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship! <br>
FLINT: In time. A thousand, two thousand years. You will know the
future, Captain Kirk. <br>
MCCOY: You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty.
You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism
throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us? <br>
FLINT: The flowers of my past. I hold the nettles of the present. I am
Flint now, with my needs. <br>
KIRK: What needs? <br>
FLINT: Tonight I have seen something wondrous, something I've waited
for, laboured for. Nothing must endanger it. At last, Rayna's emotions
have stirred to life. Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I
preserve. <br>
RAYNA: No. <br>
FLINT: Rayna. <br>
RAYNA: You must not do this to them. <br>
FLINT: I must. <br>
SPOCK: What will you feel for him after we are gone? <br>
MCCOY: All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates
you. <br>
KIRK: Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us. <br>
(The model Enterprise disappears, and appears back in orbit) <br>
KIRK: That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You
realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me,
because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now you’re just
going to take over. <br>
FLINT: I shall take what is mine when she comes to me. We are mated,
Captain, alike, immortal. You must forget your feelings in this matter,
which is quite impossible for you. <br>
KIRK: Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't
love her, but I do love her. And she loves me. <br>
FLINT: No! <br>
(They tussle) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the
circumstances. <br>
KIRK: Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman. <br>
SPOCK: No, you're not, for she is not. <br>
(Flint thumps Kirk, then repeatedly throws him across the room) <br>
RAYNA: I cannot be the cause of this. I will not be the cause of this.
Please stop. Stop! I choose where I want to go. <br>
(The men stop fighting in astonishment) <br>
RAYNA: what I want to do. I choose. I choose. <br>
FLINT: Rayna! <br>
RAYNA: No. Do not order me. No one can order me! <br>
KIRK: She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to
the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she’s human. The human
spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she
wishes. <br>
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger. <br>
FLINT: No man beats me. <br>
KIRK: I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs
to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills,
to do as she wills, to think as she wills. <br>
FLINT: That's what I've worked for. <br>
KIRK: Rayna, come with me. <br>
FLINT: Stay. <br>
RAYNA: I was not human. Now I love. I love. <br>
(She collapses. McCoy checks for a pulse) <br>
FLINT: You can't die. <br>
KIRK: What happened? <br>
SPOCK: She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor,
even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the
awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not
bear to hurt either of you.
The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Spock. <br>
SPOCK: The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise
is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered. <br>
KIRK: A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on
a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget. <br>
(He rests his head on his arms, on the desk. McCoy enters) <br>
MCCOY: Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last. <br>
SPOCK: Your report, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally
correlated: He's dying. You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of
its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality.
He'll live the remainder of a normal life span, then die. <br>
SPOCK: On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of
his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human
condition. And who knows what he might come up with. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed. <br>
MCCOY: Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can.
Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You
wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for
you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love
can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the
desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All
of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't
written into your book. Goodnight, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Goodnight, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: I do wish he could forget her. <br>
(McCoy leaves. Spock goes over to Kirk and initiates a mind meld) <br>
SPOCK: Forget. </font> </p>

KIRK: Where is everyone? <br>
MCCOY: Perhaps they weren't expecting us. <br>
SPOCK: Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual
check of every scientific expedition is routine. <br>
KIRK: I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of
this expedition, an hour ago. <br>
MCCOY: Did he report anything wrong? <br>
KIRK: No, yet there was something wrong. I can't pin it down. His
conversation was disjointed, his thoughts a little foggy, unrelated.
Chekov, check that building. Mister Spock and I will check this one.
The rest of you, take a look around. See if you can find anyone. <br>
(Chekov goes into the dark building - it has no windows - and the light
comes on as he bumps up against a table bearing the body of a very old
man. He panics and runs out again.) <br>
CHEKOV: Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
CHEKOV: A man, sir. In there. A dead man. </font></p>

reaches the table in the middle of the room.) <br>

SPOCK: Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this
expedition before we beamed down. I assure you that none of them were <br>

mission to re-supply the experimental colony

six members of the colony,
none of whom were over thirty, we found four had died and two were
dying of old age.

ROBERT: What happened? <br>
KIRK: Did your instruments show anything? <br>
ROBERT: Elaine was so beautiful. So beautiful. So beautiful. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked
you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your
administrative area. <br>
STOCKER: I appreciate that, sir. <br>
KIRK: Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you
working very closely Doctor McCoy. <br>
WALLACE: (a young blonde woman in a pink dress) Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in? <br>
MCCOY: The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're
growing older by the minute. Much older. My examinations have turned up
absolutely nothing. In fact, I don't have a clue. <br>
KIRK: What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The
atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays. <br>
KIRK: We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the
Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are
using this colony as guinea pigs. <br>
SPOCK: I have already begun investigation into that possibility,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own
departments. No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want
it run down. We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer. <br>
STOCKER: I'm sure you understand that I'm anxious to get to Starbase
Ten to assume my new post. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make
your duty. <br>
STOCKER: Thank you, sir. <br>
(Everyone leaves, but Doctor Wallace remains seated.) <br>
KIRK: Doctor, is there something I can do for you? <br>
WALLACE: Well, be a little less the cool, efficient Captain and a
little more the old friend. <br>
KIRK: How long has it been? <br>
WALLACE: Six years, four months, and an odd number of days. You mean
you don't know? <br>
KIRK: Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started
all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship, and
neither one of us will change. <br>
WALLACE: You said it. I didn't. In all those years, I only heard from
you once. A stargram when my husband died. You know, you never asked me
why I got married after we called it off. <br>
KIRK: Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved. <br>
WALLACE: I met a man I admired. A great man. <br>
KIRK: And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing. <br>
WALLACE: No. Just you. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk, Mister Spock would like to see you on the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SULU: Standard orbit, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Maintain. <br>
SPOCK: I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out
as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and
normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary. <br>
KIRK: What about the comet that astrophysics reported? <br>
SPOCK: We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The
comet was a rogue and has never been investigated. <br>
STOCKER: Captain Kirk? <br>
KIRK: Yes, Commodore. <br>
STOCKER: Facilities at Starbase Ten are much more complete than those
on board ship. It seems to me that your investigations would be
facilitated if we proceeded there. I assure you all co-operation. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few
facilities of our own here. I think the Enterprise will do quite
nicely. I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock. Maintain standard orbit,
Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: You already gave that command, sir. <br>

KIRK: Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain. <br>

you've been running this ship lately. <br>

pain.) <br>
MCCOY: Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you. <br>

personnel who beamed down to the planet's surface, Doctor McCoy,
Engineer Scott, Mister Spock, Lieutenant Galway, and myself are all
showing definite signs of aging. Only Ensign Chekov appears to be
normal.

bio-bed, Kirk and McCoy are definitely
looking older. Chapel and Wallace are also present.) <br>
KIRK: Report, Bones. <br>
MCCOY: All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of
Chekov, are aging at various rates. Approximately thirty years for each
day. I don't know what's causing it. A virus, a bacteria, or evil
spirits, but I'm trying to find out. <br>
KIRK: Spock, could I ask for some figures? <br>
SPOCK: (looking about the same as usual) Based on what Doctor McCoy
gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to
live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our
bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably
lesser time. <br>
KIRK: Total senility? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. In a very short time. <br>
KIRK: What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities,
all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research
immediately. I want the answers, and I want the remedy. Let's start by
finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected. <br>
MCCOY: I'm doing what I can. (to Spock) You're perfectly healthy. <br>
SPOCK: (sitting up) I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having
difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight
appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to
me to be increasingly cold. <br>
MCCOY: I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock. You are
perfectly healthy, that is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of a
hundred. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, can I go back to my station? <br>
KIRK: You feel up to it? <br>
SCOTT: Of course I do. I just need a wee bit of rest, that's all. <br>
(He leaves, with Spock giving him a hand.) <br>
MCCOY: You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway. Lieutenant Galway? <br>
GALWAY: What? You spoke to me, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why
don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep. <br>
GALWAY: No. I don't want to sleep. Can't you understand? If I sleep,
what will I find when I wake up? <br>
(Camera finally pans over to show us an old woman with a dowagers
hump.) <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Galway, assume your position. Start your duties. <br>
GALWAY: Thank you, sir. (on her way out) What a stupid place to hang a
mirror. <br>

MCCOY: People age normally at different speeds, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Why hasn't he aged? <br>
MCCOY: I don't know. <br>

heritage, his glands, his genes? <br>

WALLACE: We both go in the same direction. <br>
KIRK: So we do. <br>
WALLACE: Look, we know the problem. We know the progress of the
affliction. Therefore, once we find the proper line of research, it's
only logical we find the solution. <br>
KIRK: You sound like my first officer. <br>
WALLACE: No problem is insoluble. Not even ours. <br>
KIRK: That didn't spring from logic. <br>
WALLACE: Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic. The heart is
not a logical organ. When I married Theodore Wallace, I thought I was
over you. I was wrong. <br>
KIRK: When did you realise that? Today? <br>
WALLACE: What? <br>
KIRK: How much older was your husband than you? <br>

WALLACE: Twenty six years. <br>
KIRK: That's quite a difference. <br>

outpost. We were working together. I don't want to talk about him. I
want to talk about us. <br>

Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. I was just thinking. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, sir. Quite understandable. <br>
KIRK: You have something to report? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction. <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly
through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we
discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range
of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation
levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet. <br>
KIRK: Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy
immediately. Oh. Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command. Due
to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two. <br>
UHURA: But, Captain, the Romulans have broken Code two. If you remember
the last bulletin <br>
KIRK: Then use Code three. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. Code three. <br>
KIRK: Message. Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma
Hydra Four. Said comet is now, <br>
SPOCK: (consulting PADD) Quadrant four four eight, sir. <br>
KIRK: Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of
radiation and means found to neutralise it. Comet is highly dangerous.
Kirk, commanding Enterprise. Immediately, Lieutenant. Let's go. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee. <br>
SULU: You mean another twenty thousand, Captain? <br>
KIRK: I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being
questioned. Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu. <br>

SPOCK: Commodore? <br>
STOCKER: Mister Spock, a starship can function with a Chief Engineer, a
Chief Medical Officer, even a First Officer under physical par. But
it's disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any
less than perfection. <br>
SPOCK: I am aware of that. <br>
STOCKER: Please understand me. My admiration for Captain Kirk is
unbounded. He is a great officer. But Mister Spock, I need your help
and your co-operation. <br>
SPOCK: For what, sir? <br>
STOCKER: I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise. <br>
SPOCK: On what grounds, Commodore? <br>
STOCKER: On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is
unable to perform his duties. <br>
SPOCK: Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same
affliction? <br>
STOCKER: Yes, but you're a Vulcan. You have a much greater life span.
You show the affects to a much smaller degree. <br>
SPOCK: I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental
capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command. <br>
STOCKER: Well, if you are not, with your Vulcan physique, then
obviously Captain Kirk cannot be. <br>
SPOCK: Sir, I do have duties to perform. <br>
STOCKER: Mister Spock. I do not like what I'm about to say but
regulations demand it. And as a
Starfleet flag officer, I must follow regulations. As second in command
of the Enterprise, you must convene an extraordinary competency
hearing. <br>
SPOCK: I resist that suggestion, Commodore. <br>
STOCKER: It's not a matter of choice. When a captain is unfit,
physically or mentally, a competency hearing is mandatory. Please don't
make me quote a regulation which you know as well as I do. <br>

hours.

these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable
members of the Starfleet. I have tried to convince Captain Kirk of the
necessity of proceeding to Starbase Ten, but I've been overruled in
each case. The responsibility of this hearing is mine. <br>
SPOCK: On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second
in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk,
would you like to make a statement? <br>

SPOCK: Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Did he order you to increase orbit? <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Did he not several minutes later repeat that order? <br>
KIRK: He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I
don't have to repeat myself. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, please answer the question. <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a
fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and
signed. Is that correct? <br>
ATKINS: Sir, he had more important things on his mind. <br>
SPOCK: Yeoman, you will simply answer the question. <br>
ATKINS: I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it. <br>
SPOCK: You guess? <br>
ATKINS: He'd forgot he'd signed it. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here
a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have
broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom? <br>
UHURA: They are. <br>
SPOCK: And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours? <br>
UHURA: Those of Captain Kirk. <br>
SPOCK: Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which
passed Gamma Hydra Four? <br>
UHURA: He did. <br>
SPOCK: Using Code two. <br>
UHURA: Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three. <br>
SPOCK: After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two. <br>
UHURA: Yes. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy! <br>
MCCOY: (waking up) Yes, Spock? What is it? <br>
SPOCK: Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a
complete physical examination of Captain Kirk. <br>
MCCOY: I did. <br>
SPOCK: Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using
established norms as comparative base. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. Subject's physical age based on physiological
profile, between sixty and seventy two. Aging rapidly. <br>
KIRK: No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old. <br>
STOCKER: The computer differs with you, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy. <br>
MCCOY: Yes. <br>
SPOCK: Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's
present physical condition. <br>
MCCOY: Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical
degeneration which strongly resembles aging. <br>
SPOCK: Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's
physical age. Do you agree with it? <br>
MCCOY: It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine. <br>
SPOCK: Do you agree with it, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim. <br>
SPOCK: This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore
Stocker, have something that you would like to add. <br>
STOCKER: No. I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk? <br>
KIRK: I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister
Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I would suggest <br>
KIRK: No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only
one reason, and
one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma
Hydra Two <br>
SPOCK: Gamma Hydra Four, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes. A slip of the tongue. <br>
SPOCK: You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and
signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical
analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would
appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental
conditions. <br>
KIRK: So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My
ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about
a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a
captain of his command is, well, that's, that's.
Spock, I wouldn't have believed it of you. Go ahead. Ask me questions.
I'll show you what I'm capable of. There's nothing wrong with my
memory. Go ahead! Ask me anything! We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra
Two, right? Anyhow, it doesn't matter. There's a lot more to running a
starship than answering a lot of fool questions. A lot more. Go ahead.
Ask me questions. <br>
SPOCK: We have no more questions, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Ask me anything. Anything. <br>
SPOCK: There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the
room so the board can vote <br>
KIRK: Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to
running the ship. The most fool thing I ever heard of. Competency
hearing when there's work to be done. I'll be in my quarters, awaiting
your decision. (leaves) <br>
STOCKER: Well, since the senior officers are incapable and I am of flag
rank, I am forced by regulations to assume command. <br>
SPOCK: Sir, you have never commanded a starship. <br>
STOCKER: What would you have, a junior officer with far less experience
than I have? <br>
SPOCK: The danger from the Romulans <br>
STOCKER: Mister Spock, we have to save these people. Mister Sulu, set a
direct course for Starbase Ten. Warp five. <br>
SULU: Across the Neutral Zone? <br>
STOCKER: Immediately, Mister Sulu. All officers are to return to their
posts. </font></p>

SPOCK: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: So, I've been relieved. <br>
SPOCK: I'm sorry, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney. <br>
SPOCK: Regulations require <br>
KIRK: Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all
along. First little excuse you get <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I have not assumed command. <br>
KIRK: I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed
command? <br>
SPOCK: I suffer the same affliction as you, sir. <br>
KIRK: If you're not in command, who is? <br>
SPOCK: Commodore Stocker. <br>
KIRK: Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking
officer <br>
KIRK: No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound
paper-pusher. I order you to take command. <br>
SPOCK: I cannot, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Are you refusing a direct order? <br>
SPOCK: No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard
this ship. <br>
KIRK: You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first
chance you get? Spock. Get out. I never want to have to look at you
again. <br>

WALLACE: Oh, Jim. I'm sorry. Truly I am. <br>
KIRK: I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them
confuse me, rattle me. <br>
WALLACE: Everybody understood. <br>
KIRK: But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make
a man old. And you don't run a starship with your arms. You run it with
your head. My brain's as sharp as it ever was. A simple case of
radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command. I admit I'm
getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you. <br>
WALLACE: Oh, Jim, will you forgive me? I have work to do. <br>
KIRK: Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old? </font></p>

MCCOY: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. <br>
KIRK: Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together.
We were on the surface together. The same spot. We were together all
the time. <br>
SPOCK: No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments. <br>
KIRK: He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock,
something happened. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember <br>
KIRK: He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the
building and he was scared to death. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster,
breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows.
Adrenal activity. Now hold on Just a minute. There was something that I
read once. It was ancient history, just after the atomic age. Used for
radiation sickness. Adrenaline. <br>
WALLACE: Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation
sickness. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early
research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered. <br>
SPOCK: Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious
compound could be developed. <br>

cracking. </font></p>

inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and
under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will
implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed.
Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all
matter in a two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish a
corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for
the next four solar years. Explosion will take place in one minute.

CAPTAIN: What is it, Webb? <br>
WEBB: A blip, sir. Just came on the screen. <br>
CAPTAIN: How do you read it? <br>
WEBB: Aircraft of some sort. By the size of it and the speed, it's not
one of ours, sir. It doesn't even read like anything I've ever seen. <br>
CAPTAIN: What was the approach? <br>
WEBB: None, sir. It was just there, like it fell out of the sky or
something. <br>
CAPTAIN: (suddenly interested) Current position? <br>
WEBB: Directly over the Omaha installation, sir. Holding there. <br>
CAPTAIN: Watch the scope, Webb. Air Defence will want to send somebody
up for a closer look. We may have a real UFO on our hands. <br>

Enterprise flying across the blue sky.)

Starbase 9 for resupply when a black star of high gravitational
attraction began to drag us toward it. It required all warp power in
reverse to pull us away from the star. But, like snapping a rubber
band, the breakaway sent us plunging through space, out of control, to
stop here, wherever we are.

SPOCK: Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries.
Engineering reports warp engines
non-operational. Mister Scott overrode the automatic helm setting and
is holding us in orbit on impulse power. <br>
KIRK: Orbit where? <br>
SPOCK: Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction
when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us
on in the same direction. <br>

Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape
velocity. <br>

SULU: Yes, sir. Helm answering. She's sluggish, sir. <br>
UHURA: Captain, normal Starfleet channel has nothing but static. I'm
getting something on another frequency, but it's not Starfleet. <br>

CHRISTOPHER [OC]: Acknowledged. Closing on target. <br>
SPOCK: Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor,
equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he
hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our
capacity to repair under current circumstances. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold

KIRK: All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile, let me apologise for
bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly, but it couldn't be helped.
I didn't know that your craft couldn't stand up to our tractor beam. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Don't give me any double-talk. Just tell me who you are. <br>

KIRK: Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant
Commander Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. <br>
KIRK: Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything, but I
think you'll find it interesting. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our
deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again
as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. <br>
KIRK: Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind? <br>
SPOCK: Captain Christopher. <br>
KIRK: What about him? <br>
SPOCK: We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too
much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to
Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain
certain knowledge of man's future?
Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations.
and in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain,
you and I and all that we know might not even exist. <br>
KIRK: Your logic can be most annoying. <br>

warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and reenergised. <br>

COMPUTER: Computed, dear. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking
systems repaired. <br>
SPOCK: I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will
require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of
three weeks at a
Starbase. <br>
KIRK: I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate. <br>
SPOCK: It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: I take it that a lady computer is not routine. <br>
SPOCK: We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance.
Cygnet Fourteen is a planet dominated by women. They seemed to feel the
ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female,
of course. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Well, you people certainly have interesting problems. I'd
love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out, but&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: I'm afraid you'll have to. We can't send you back. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Can't? Spock here told me that your transporter can beam
down an object even from an orbit this high. <br>
KIRK: It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future
looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change the course of
it, destroy it. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Well then my disappearance would change something, too. <br>
SPOCK: I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show
no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time accident story.
The experts can figure out who you are and what you are. It's my duty
to report what I've seen. Well, what would you do? <br>
KIRK: I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk. <br>

back with what he knows. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do, sit up here and
wait for our supplies to run out, our power to die? It has to
eventually, you know. We certainly can't go back to Earth. It would be
worse than the Captain being returned. There are four hundred and
thirty of us, and that means four hundred and thirty chances of
altering the future. <br>
KIRK: Yes. But we're not in that position yet. <br>

SPOCK: I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after
all. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Why? You said I made no relative contribution. <br>
SPOCK: Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial
run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I
find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel
Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful
Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Acknowledging that we must return Captain
Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the
explanation of his return.
We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it.
It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska. <br>
KIRK: That means those search parties will be crawling all over that
wreckage. <br>
SPOCK: And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras. I
got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures of you. Air Defence
Command will be processing that film fast. And ADC Control was probably
recording my radio transmissions. <br>
KIRK: If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as
weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane.
It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine
UFO. Possibly alien, definitely destructive. <br>
KIRK: What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us
back to our own time? <br>
SPOCK: A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us.
Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred
variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're
in now. <br>
KIRK: We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos.
If the Captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be
any evidence to support him. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: That makes me out to be either a liar or a fool. <br>
KIRK: Perhaps. <br>
SPOCK: Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he
saw a UFO. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Captain, I know that base. I was stationed there a year
ago. I'd like to <br>
KIRK: No, Captain. Thank you, but if anything should go wrong, you
might get hurt. We couldn't risk that. Neither could you or your son. <br>

takes the gun and communicator out of his hands.) <br>

lots of noise so Sulu can hear what is going on. He's eventually
restrained, and the Colonel takes a look in the dark room. It's empty.)
<br>

KIRK: What other one? <br>
FELLINI: Your partner. I saw you looking that was and I saw somebody

SPOCK: Spock here. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: We've completed re-energising the warp engines, sir. We can
re-fire them anytime. <br>

SCOTT [OC]: Aye, sir. Engine room out. <br>
SPOCK: (examining a roll of film) Poor photography. <br>
MCCOY: Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about
Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a
communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without
one. <br>

start communicating. I want to know how you got in here. That's a
simple question. Give me a simple answer. Nobody saw you. You got all
the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it? <br>
KIRK: Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me. <br>
FELLINI: Don't try to be funny. How did you get in? <br>
KIRK: I popped in out of thin air. <br>
FELLINI: You seem to think this is some kind of a game. <br>
KIRK: No, Colonel. I know it's no game. <br>
FELLINI: All right. What did you say your name was? <br>
KIRK: For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk. <br>
FELLINI: And how did you get inside a top security installation, James
T. Kirk? <br>
KIRK: I told you, you wouldn't believe me. <br>
(The Colonel picks up the communicator) <br>
KIRK: Colonel, would you mind being careful with that? <br>
FELLINI: That worries you a little bit, huh? What is that, a radio?
Transmitter of some kind? <br>
KIRK: Of some kind. <br>
FELLINI: You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like
mysteries. <br>
KIRK: If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one. A
big one. <br>
FELLINI: I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies,
mister. We know how to find out things we want to know. (tosses it to
the guard standing nearby) What is that? Is that a uniform of some
kind? <br>
KIRK: This little thing? Just something I slipped on. <br>
FELLINI: Kirk, maybe you don't realise how serious this is. Sabotage of
a government installation <br>
KIRK: Did I sabotage something? <br>
FELLINI: No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we
hadn't found you? <br>
KIRK: Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all. <br>
FELLINI: Is that what you're here for? Nothing at all? <br>
KIRK: That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered. <br>
FELLINI: All right, Kirk. Maybe this will make you laugh. Sabotage,
espionage, unauthorised entry, burglary. How are those for starters?
And I can think up lots more if you don't start talking. <br>
KIRK: All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from
Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place. You ought to see it. <br>
FELLINI: I am going to lock you up for two hundred years. <br>
KIRK: That ought to be just about right. </font></p>

section. Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take a little
time for someone to get there. <br>
SPOCK: Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam
down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Yes, but you're not going to get them unless you take me
with you. <br>
SPOCK: I can't do that, Captain. <br>
MCCOY: If something went wrong <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam
down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me.
The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief. <br>

Colonel Fellini's lights out.)
SPOCK: Don't you find that painful, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Yes, I do. What's he doing here? <br>
SPOCK: He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the
base. It was necessary to bring him along. <br>
KIRK: I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes? <br>
SULU: Mister Spock ran them through. They were the right ones. We got
them all. <br>

don't have to return me now, Captain. Spock, come out of there. <br>

CHRISTOPHER: I told you it's my duty to report everything I've seen.
That's explanation enough. Spock! <br>

attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers
will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory and a few facts.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Briefing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Mister Scott and I both agree that the only
possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us
here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out
its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash
will propel us into another time warp. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: Slingshot effects are fine for you people. How do you
propose to return the Sergeant and me? <br>
SPOCK: Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll
begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond
yesterday,
beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free
will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any
of this happened. <br>
KIRK: You won't have anything to remember, because it never would have
happened. <br>
CHRISTOPHER: What if you can't pull free of the sun? <br>
SCOTT: Oh, we'll do that all right, Captain. We'll not be getting so
close that my engines couldn't pull us out. What I am worried about,
sir, that we may not have much control when we're thrown forward again.
<br>
KIRK: Helm control? <br>
SCOTT: Braking control, sir. If I can't stop us soon enough, we may
overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly the strain may
tear us apart. Anyway we do it, it's a mighty rough ride. <br>
KIRK: Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one
is all you have. Assume your stations. </font></p>

be chosen for the space
programme but I didn't qualify. <br>

of them. <br>
SULU: Sir, our speed is increasing. We're travelling at over warp
eight. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased
greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the
chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of
time passage will now increase. <br>
KIRK: Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain
Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry. <br>

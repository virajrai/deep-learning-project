<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SULU: All observation stations, take final
readings. This'll be our last orbit. <br>
KIRK: Spock, any answers? <br>
SPOCK: I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the
planet surface, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there. <br>
SPOCK: Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under
observation. <br>
SULU: I'm reading it now, Mister Spock. It seems to indicate artificial
power being generated in factor seven quantities. <br>
SPOCK: Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there. <br>
MCCOY: What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet,
Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous. <br>
SPOCK: Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some
natural phenomena. <br>
MCCOY: Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space
legends. There's no intelligent life here. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, anything from the planet? <br>
UHURA: I've repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency, sir. There's
no response on any channel. <br>
KIRK: Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the
planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and
investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SULU: Completing final orbit, sir. <br>
KIRK: Prepare to warp us out. <br>
(The red light on the navigation console flashes, and the lights dim) <br>
KIRK: Alert status. <br>
SPOCK: We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift. <br>
(The lights come back up, and the planet disappears from the
viewscreen) <br>
MCCOY: Jim! <br>
(On the screen is the image of a man sitting in a large leather chair,
and wearing a stove-pipe hat) <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Captain Kirk, I believe. A pleasure to make
your acquaintance, sir. <br>
KIRK: Uhura <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: No need to check your voice telegraph device.
Do I gather that you recognise me? <br>
KIRK: I recognise what you appear to be. <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: And appearances can be most deceiving, but not
in this case, James Kirk. I am Abraham Lincoln. <br>
KIRK: Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: I have been described in many ways, Mister
Spock, but never with that word. <br>
KIRK: I was requesting your analysis, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained
sufficient information to present this illusion. <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Illusion? Captain, will you permit me to come
aboard your vessel? No doubt you have devices which can check my
reality. <br>
KIRK: We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Do you still measure time in minutes? <br>
KIRK: We can convert to it, sir. <br>
LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: Then you should be directly over my position
in. There. Exactly twelve and one half minutes. Until then, Captain. <br>
(And the orange planet is back in view) <br>
KIRK: (signing a PADD) Thank you, Mister Mulney. <br>
SPOCK: Small change occurring there, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Magnification four, helm. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SPOCK: An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It
measures completely Earth-like. <br>
SULU: Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. <br>
CHEKOV: He called it to the second, sir. We'll be over it in exactly
twelve minutes now. <br>
KIRK: Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately,
phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln? <br>
KIRK: It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full
dress uniforms.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Scott is in kilt and plaid, the three security
guards look smart) <br>
SCOTT: Full dress? Presidential honours? What is this nonsense, Mister
Dickerson? <br>
DICKERSON: I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Ha! You're daft, man. <br>
DICKERSON: All I know is what the captain tells me, and he says he'll
have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles. <br>
(McCoy enters) <br>
SCOTT: I'd have expected sanity from the ship's surgeon, at least.
President Lincoln, indeed. No doubt to be followed by Louis of France
and Robert the Bruce. <br>
(Kirk and Spock enter) <br>
KIRK: If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is
actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and
apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome,
we'll do as the Romans do. <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Bridge to Transporter room. One minute to overhead
position. <br>
SCOTT: Locked on to something. Does that appear human to you, Mister
Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like
living rock with heavy fore claws. It’s settling down now to completely
human readings. <br>
SCOTT: We can beam it aboard anytime now, sir. <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human.
Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mister Spock. Security, stand
ready. <br>
DICKERSON: Phaser team, set ready for a heavy stun. <br>
SPOCK: Band honours ready, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Energise. <br>
(A tall, lean figure in a black frock coat is beamed aboard to drum
beat and a bosun's whistle) <br>
KIRK: The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister
President. <br>
LINCOLN: Strange. Where are the musicians? <br>
KIRK: That's taped music, sir. A starship on active duty never carries
an honour detachment. <br>
LINCOLN: Taped music, you say. Well, perhaps Mister Spock will be good
enough to explain that to me later. A most interesting way to come
aboard, Captain. What was the device used? <br>
KIRK: An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are
converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted
back into their original pattern. <br>
LINCOLN: Well, since I'm obviously here, and quite whole, whatever you
mean apparently works very well indeed. Gentlemen, if those are
weapons, please lower them. At my age, I'm afraid I'm not very
dangerous. <br>
MCCOY: Human, Jim. <br>
LINCOLN: All too human, Doctor McCoy. Happy to make your acquaintance. <br>
KIRK: Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock,
second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer
Dickerson. <br>
LINCOLN: Mister Spock, Mister Scott, Mister Dickerson. Gentlemen, I
hope to talk to each of you. But meanwhile, your captain is consumed
with questions and I shall do my utmost to answer them.
And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine. At
your service, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters.
Mister President. <br>
LINCOLN: A most interesting vessel. <br>
(Kirk, Lincoln, Spock and security leave) <br>
MCCOY: Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard? <br>
SCOTT: You heard Mister Spock yourself. Mineral he called it, like
living rock. <br>
MCCOY: And that became Lincoln? <br>
SCOTT: I couldn't tell. It may have been another figure down there
standing by. What do you make of it? <br>
MCCOY: I'm not quite sure.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 5906.4. Who or what has
been beamed aboard our vessel? An alien who has changed himself into
this form? An illusion? I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham
Lincoln could have actually been reincarnated. And yet his kindness,
his gentle wisdom, his humour, everything about him is so right.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation
balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred
and forty three miles above the surface of this planet. <br>
LINCOLN: You can measure great distances that closely? <br>
SPOCK: We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty
one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your
old-style measurements. <br>
LINCOLN: Bless me. <br>
UHURA: Excuse me, Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Mister Scott <br>
LINCOLN: What a charming negress. Oh, forgive me, my dear. I know in my
time some used that term as a description of property. <br>
UHURA: But why should I object to that term, sir? You see, in our
century we've learned not to fear words. <br>
KIRK: May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura. <br>
LINCOLN: The foolishness of my century had me apologising where no
offense was given. <br>
KIRK: We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans
learned that centuries before we did. <br>
SPOCK: It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a
number of things to make existence worthwhile. <br>
LINCOLN: Yes. Philosophy of Nome, meaning all. How did I know that?
Just as I seem to know that on the planet surface you will meet one of
the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet. My
mind cannot recall his name, but I know he will be there. What is it
that powers your vessel, Captain? May I see your engine room? <br>
KIRK: Certainly. Our engineering officer <br>
UHURA: Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two
hours. <br>
KIRK: Oh, dear. If you’ll forgive me, our communications officer <br>
LINCOLN: I would be delighted to have her as guide. <br>
KIRK: Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Briefing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Where the devil are they? <br>
SCOTT: Why, they're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the
galley. They've been everywhere else. <br>
(Kirk and Spock enter) <br>
KIRK: Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image. <br>
KIRK: I doubt that, Bones, but continue. <br>
MCCOY: Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has
seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can’t possibly
be the real article. <br>
SCOTT: Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light
years away. <br>
SPOCK: More that direction, Engineer. <br>
MCCOY: You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever
a science officer does at a time like this? <br>
SPOCK: I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien. <br>
MCCOY: At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien. <br>
KIRK: Yes, of course he's an alien. <br>
MCCOY And he's potentially dangerous. <br>
SCOTT: Mad. Loony as an Arcturian dogbird. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to
beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, a big one. Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of
Earth-type environment down there. Now is it really there, or do we
just think we see it down there? <br>
SCOTT: You might beam down into a sea of molten lava. <br>
KIRK: But why would he want to kill only two of us? <br>
SPOCK: It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily
trick us into destroying the entire vessel. <br>
MCCOY: Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam
down there? <br>
SPOCK: No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there
for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some
logical reason for all of this. <br>
KIRK: Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that? <br>
SPOCK: Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.
President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What
better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for
you. <br>
KIRK: But not only to me, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work
of duplication. <br>
MCCOY: But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's
interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the
decision whether to beam down or not. <br>
SCOTT: Don't do it, Captain. <br>
KIRK: The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact
with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we
have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock,
as for you <br>
SPOCK: Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact,
I must beam down with you. <br>
MCCOY: You're both out of your heads! <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: And you're on the edge of insubordination. <br>
MCCOY: Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain
that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able
to patch together again? <br>
SCOTT: Aye! <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock,
standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln
to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately. </font></p>

ship? <br>
LINCOLN: Please, believe me. I know nothing other than what I have
already told you. <br>
KIRK: The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone

Captain Kirk. <br>

extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible. <br>
SURAK: Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response? <br>
SPOCK: Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold
true. <br>
SURAK: The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind,
Spock. <br>
SPOCK: As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg
forgiveness. <br>
SURAK: The cause was more than sufficient. Let us speak no further of
it. In my time, we knew not of Earth men. I am pleased to see that we
have differences. May we together become greater than the sum of both
of us. <br>
KIRK: Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer. <br>
(A rock changes into a creature with heavy fore-claws) <br>
ROCK: You'll have an answer soon, Captain. Our world is called
Excalbia. Countless who live on that planet are watching.
Before this drama unfolds, we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and
Spock. <br>
KIRK: We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean,
drama about to unfold? <br>
ROCK: You're intelligent life form, but I'm surprised you do not
perceive the honour we do you. Have we not created in this place on our
planet a stage identical to your own world? <br>
KIRK: We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in
friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your
world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel. <br>
ROCK: Your objection is well taken. We shall communicate with your
vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the
play. Behold. <br>
(More people arrive. A human, a Mongol, an alien woman and a Klingon) <br>
ROCK: Captain, Mister Spock, some of these you may know through
history. Genghis Khan, for one. And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal
war early in the 21st century on Earth. Zora, who experimented with the
body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon.
Kahless the Unforgettable, the Klingon who set the pattern for his
planet's tyrannies. We welcome the vessel Enterprise

KIRK: What do you mean, survival? <br>

evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is
strongest. <br>

LINCOLN: I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen, until we do what
it demands of us. <br>

attitude toward this charade. It's ridiculous to think that we should
take part in it. <br>

GREEN: The same thing as you do, to get out of here. I have no quarrel
with you any more than you have with me. <br>
KIRK: You're somewhat different than the way history paints you,
Colonel Green. <br>
GREEN: History tends to exaggerate. I suggest we call a halt to this at
once and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties. My
associates are in full agreement with me. Captain, you were tricked
into coming here, weren't you? So were we all. <br>
KIRK: Where do you come from? <br>
GREEN: I can't remember. Isn't that strange? My memory used to be quite
remarkable. Well, wherever it was, I want to get back. So it seems to
me, Captain, that we have a common cause, and our enemy is that
creature. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREEN [on viewscreen]: That we combine forces, and
reason some way to overcome it. <br>

should arrive together at a peaceful settlement. <br>

demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful. You find my body

KIRK [OC]: What caused that? <br>
SCOTT: There's no knowing and there's no stopping it either. The
shielding is breaking down. I estimate four hours before it goes
completely. Four hours before the ship blows up. </font></p>

blow itself to bits within four hours, Captain, unless you defeat the

KAHLESS: Yes. <br>
GREEN: What did you find out? What are they doing? <br>
KAHLESS: They've done nothing. They've not armed themselves nor
prepared for any kind of defence. I say attack now and finish them. <br>
GREEN: With what? These? (pointed sticks) <br>
KAHLESS: Better than what they have. <br>
GREEN: No, it's not advantage enough. I want to make sure the odds are
in our favour. Overwhelm and devastate, that's the way to get power and

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: There's nothing immoral about fighting an
illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and
all the crewmen aboard. <br>
SPOCK: And if they’re real, Captain? <br>
KIRK: We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach
without being seen. <br>
LINCOLN: Are we fighting a defensive war, James? <br>
KIRK: No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a
place to retreat to. What I want to do now is scout them out, find
their weaknesses and attack. <br>
LINCOLN: Do you drink whiskey? <br>
KIRK: Occasionally. Why? <br>
LINCOLN: Because you have qualities very much like those of another man
I admire greatly. General Grant. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe
the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling
as a boy. <br>
LINCOLN: Indeed I did. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course. <br>
KIRK: We don't have much time, Spock. <br>
SURAK: In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives.
We'd suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet.
Another was about to begin. We were torn. But out of our suffering some
of us found the discipline to act. We sent emissaries to our opponents
to propose peace. The first were killed, but others followed.
Ultimately we achieved peace, which has lasted since then. <br>
KIRK: Circumstances were different then, Surak. <br>
SURAK: The face of war has never changed, Captain. Surely it is more
logical to heal than kill. <br>
KIRK: I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here. <br>
SURAK: That is precisely why we should not fight. <br>
KIRK: My ship is at stake. <br>
SURAK: I will not harm others, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain. <br>
KIRK: So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way
out of this <br>
SURAK: The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After
all, I'm no warrior. <br>
SPOCK: The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will
do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let
him attempt it. <br>
KIRK: You saw how treacherously they acted. <br>
SURAK: Oh, yes. But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually
being tested. <br>
KIRK: I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best. <br>
SURAK: Thank you. May you live long and prosper. <br>
KIRK: The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails.

there, Vulcan. State your purpose. <br>

GREEN: Are you surrendering? <br>
SURAK I'm doing what I consider best for all of us. If you choose to
regard that as surrender, I accept your definition.
<br>KAHLESS: One of those peace lovers, Colonel. <br>

SURAK: Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in. <br>
GREEN: What do I get out of it? I fight for gain, Vulcan. What do I
gain here? <br>

Colonel, that we have common cause to survive. Together we can. But not
by warring. <br>

(Kahless and Khan circle around) <br>

the father of our civilisation. The father image holds much meaning for
us. <br>

us to act rashly. <br>

SPOCK: I am not insensitive to it, Captain. <br>
SURAK [OC]: Help me, Spock! <br>
KIRK: But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for
us to attempt a rescue. <br>
KIRK: I can’t just let him stay there. <br>
LINCOLN: Perhaps we can rescue him, Mister Spock. Now, I suggest that
we do whatever they want. <br>
KIRK: Do what they want, sir? <br>
LINCOLN: Not the way they want it, however. We must first convince them
that they have provoked us to recklessness. James, I do not mean to
presume upon your authority. What I propose is that I circle around to
their rear while you two provide a frontal assault. It should be
sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do. <br>
KIRK: And what will you do? <br>
LINCOLN: Why, slip into their camp and free him. <br>
KIRK: No. <br>

doubt that you could do what I was bred to. <br>

LINCOLN: I am no longer president. Mister Spock, any comment? <br>
SURAK [OC]: Help me, Spock! <br>
SPOCK: No, sir. <br>
LINCOLN: One matter further, gentlemen. We fight on their level. With
trickery, brutality, finality. We match their evil.
I know, James. I was reputed to be a gentle man. But I was commander in
chief during the four bloodiest years of my country's history. I gave
orders that sent a hundred thousand men to their death at the hands of
their brothers. There is no honourable way to kill, no gentle way to
destroy. There is nothing good in war except its ending. And you are
fighting for the lives of your crew. <br>

on his own dagger.) <br>
ROCK: You are the survivors. The others have run off. It would seem
that evil retreats when forcibly confronted. However, you have failed
to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies.
Your good and your evil use the same methods, achieve the same results.
Do you have an explanation? <br>
KIRK: You established the methods and the goals. <br>
ROCK: For you to use as you chose. <br>
KIRK: What did you offer the others if they won? <br>
ROCK: What they wanted most. Power. <br>
KIRK: You offered me the lives of my crew. <br>

things. <br>

SPOCK: Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation. <br>
KIRK: Well? <br>
SPOCK: It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able
to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was
desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after
scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter. <br>
KIRK: They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel
I actually met Lincoln. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain.
Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be
anything but what we expected them to be? <br>
KIRK: It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand
what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace. <br>
UHURA: Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance. <br>

Captain's log, stardate 5423.4. We are orbiting the planet Gideon,
which is still not a member of the United Federation of Planets. The
treaty negotiations have been difficult because Gideon has consistently
refused the presence of a delegation from the Federation on its soil,
or any surveillance by the ship's sensors. They have finally agreed to
a delegation of one. They insisted it be the Captain of the Enterprise.
I am, therefore, beaming down at once.

SPOCK: We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of
diplomacy is to prolong a crisis. <br>
MCCOY: Well, what are we waiting for, Mister Spock? We're not
diplomats. <br>
SPOCK: We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to
some fool lecture by a diplomat! <br>
SPOCK: Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at
the moment. The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we
cannot scan it. Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates. They
must be provided by Gideon. <br>
CHEKOV: We should never have agreed to such restrictions. <br>
SPOCK: We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura.
<br>
UHURA: Yes, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request
permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for
Captain Kirk. <br>
UHURA: At once, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: Are there any other possibilities? <br>

degree at a time. <br>

auditorium crowded with people. Thousands pressed in against me. I
could hardly breathe. I was fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out. <br>
KIRK: Don't be afraid. <br>
ODONA: I'm not, but you are troubled. <br>
KIRK: I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the

KIRK: Maybe you can. Tell me the rest. You were fighting for oxygen,
screaming to get out of there. <br>

was all this space. And the freedom. I just wanted to float. And then
there you were. <br>

KIRK: Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I
found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared just like that.
Now what happened during those minutes? <br>
ODONA: What is Gideon? <br>

beamed aboard from Gideon. <br>

made a most thorough search, and you will be relieved to know that you
may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about
Gideon. <br>

we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you. <br>

quiet. So peaceful. <br>

ODONA: And we're alone. Can you make it last a long, long time? <br>

ODONA: Forever. <br>
KIRK: Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And
food. We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five
years. So that should last us <br>
ODONA: Forever. All my life I've dreamed of being alone. <br>
KIRK: Most people are afraid of being alone. <br>
ODONA: Where I come from, people dream of it. <br>
KIRK: Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that? <br>
ODONA: Gideon? I told you, I don't know where I come from, what my
planet is. <br>
KIRK: It might be Gideon. <br>
ODONA: Does it matter so much? <br>
KIRK: Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location. <br>
ODONA: And then you might find your crew. Being here with you, I forgot
there must be others. I envy you your sense of loyalty. I want to ease
your feeling of dread, your fear that all your crew no longer exists. <br>
KIRK: I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us. There must be a
way. Odona. Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being
alone? <br>
ODONA: Because they never can be. <br>
KIRK: Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone? <br>
ODONA: Because there are so many of us. So many. There is no place, no
street, no house, no garden, no beach, no mountain that is not filled
with people. Each one of us would kill in order to find a place alone
to himself. They would willingly die for it, if they could. <br>
KIRK: Who sent you here? <br>
ODONA: No one commands Odona. I was not sent here. <br>
KIRK: You've come to kill. Odona, have you come to die? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Your report to the Federation was a tissue of
lies. You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that
would make Gideon a paradise. <br>
HODIN: And so it was! A long, long time ago what we described was true!
The atmosphere on Gideon has always been germ-free. And the people
flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection. Eventually, even
the life span increased. Death became almost unknown to us. It occurred
only when the body could no longer regenerate itself, and that happens
now only to the very old. <br>
KIRK: Those are conditions most people would envy. <br>
HODIN: But Gideon did not find it enviable. The birth rate continued to
rise, and the population grew, until now Gideon is encased in a living
mass who can find no rest, no peace, no joy. <br>
KIRK: Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to
sterilise men and women? <br>
HODIN: Every organ renews itself. It would be impossible. <br>
KIRK: Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent
conception. The Federation will provide anything you need. <br>
HODIN: But you see, the people of Gideon have always believed that life
is sacred. That the love of life is the greatest gift. That is the one
unshakable truth of Gideon. And this overwhelming love of life has
developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity. <br>
KIRK: And the great misery which you now face. <br>
HODIN: That is bitterly true, Captain. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the
truth which shaped our evolution. We are incapable of destroying or
interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply. Life, in
every form, from foetus to developed being. It is against our
tradition, against our very nature. We simply could not do it. <br>
KIRK: Yet you can kill a young girl. <br>
HODIN: We're trying to re-adjust the life cycle of an entire
civilisation. <br>
KIRK: You're killing your own daughter. How can you do that? <br>
HODIN: My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon. But it
was impossible. No stranger could realize the horror that life can be
here. I will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief, nor
will I parade it for you to gain your co-operation. My love for my
daughter is too deep for display. My pride in her runs even deeper. My
daughter freely chose to do what she is doing, as the people of Gideon
are free to choose. <br>
KIRK: The virus you need is very rare. Who will provide it? <br>
HODIN: You will stay. Your blood will provide it. <br>
KIRK: No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned
only a few. I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans,
and I have hopes other than death for Odona. <br>
HODIN: My daughter pleaded with you to stay. <br>
KIRK: What was said and what happened between us was for us alone. <br>
HODIN: She hoped you would love her and wish to stay. <br>
KIRK: So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that
I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice. <br>
HODIN: Stay with us. We're desperate. <br>
KRODAK: Odona's fever is rising. She's calling the name of James Kirk. <br>

leader, when lightning threatens.) <br>
THARN: We believe what you say, Captain Kirk, but our position has not
altered. The Halkan Council cannot permit your Federation to mine
dilithium crystals on our planet. <br>
KIRK: We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are
peaceful. <br>
THARN: We accept that your Federation is benevolent at present, but the
future is always in question. Our dilithium crystals represent awesome
power. Wrongful use of that power, even to the extent of the taking of
one life, would violate our history of total peace. To prevent that, we
would die, Captain. As a race, if necessary. <br>
KIRK: I admire your ethics and hope to prove ours. Kirk to Enterprise. <br>

Enterprise in orbit reverses itself. Finally, four figures solidify,
wearing strange uniforms with gold sashes. Uhura's midriff is bare.) <br>
KIRK: Spock was right. It was a rough trip. <br>
(Spock and Kyle greet their Captain with a semi-Nazi salute. Their
uniforms have changes, and Spock has grown a very fetching goatee
beard.) <br>
SPOCK: At norm, Mister Kyle. Controls at neutral. <br>
KYLE: Yes, sir. <br>

SULU [OC]: Yes, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Their military capability, Captain? <br>
KIRK: None. <br>
SPOCK: Regrettable that this society has chosen suicide. Mister Kyle,
you were instructed to compensate during the ion storm. <br>
KYLE: But I tried, Mister Spock, I tried. <br>
SPOCK: Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated. <br>
KYLE: But Mister Spock, I <br>

SPOCK: Your agoniser, please. <br>
(A guard restrains Kyle and takes a device from his belt.) <br>

agony. When it is removed, he collapses.)

minor damage in your section. There are also injuries requiring your
attention, Doctor. Well, gentlemen? <br>
KYLE: Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. <br>
KYLE: The power beam jumped for a moment, sir, as the landing party was
about to materialise. I never saw it happen before. <br>
SPOCK: Due to your error, Mister Kyle? <br>
KYLE: No, Mister Spock. Before. <br>
SPOCK: Possibly a result of the severe storm. Captain, do you feel any
abnormal effects? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over. That was a rough
beam-up. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, sir. <br>

MCCOY: No, not everything. That spot, I spilt acid there a year ago.
Jim, What in blazes is this? <br>
KIRK: I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe <br>
UHURA: Maybe what, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam? <br>
UHURA: Yes. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
KIRK: When we first materialised. <br>
SCOTT: I did. <br>
KIRK: It happened twice. First we were in our own transporter chamber,
then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here.
Wherever this is. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, the transporter chief mentioned a surge of power. The
transporter lock might have been affected by the ion storm and we just
materialised somewhere else. <br>
KIRK: Yes, here. Not our universe, not our ship. Something parallel. A
parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane.
Everything's duplicated, almost. Another Enterprise. Spock with a
beard. <br>
UHURA: Another Captain Kirk, another Doctor McCoy, another <br>
MCCOY: An exchange. If we're here <br>
KIRK: Then our counterparts must have been transporting up at the exact
same time. Similar storms on both universes disrupted the circuits.
We're here, and they're on our Enterprise. Probably asking the same
questions. Are we in another universe, and if so, how do we get back to
our own? They'll use the computer, and we have to. <br>
MCCOY: What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, can you buy me some time. Get below and short out the
main phaser couplings. They'll think the storm blew the stand-by
circuits. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Then get on this technology. It's all we have to work with if we
want to get back home. The intercom may be monitored. Use your
communicators for private messages. Subfrequency and scramble. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>
(Scott leaves) <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Get to your post. Run today's communication from Starfleet

very nasty scar down his face.) <br>
SULU: Still no interest, Uhura? Hmm? I could change your mind. <br>
UHURA: You are away from your post, Mister. <br>
SULU: Is the captain here? Is Spock here? When the cat's away <br>

KIRK: Communications status. <br>
UHURA: No storm damage, sir. All stations report normal. (quietly)
You're ordered to annihilate the Halkans unless they comply. No
alternative. <br>

UHURA: Yes, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Captain? <br>
KIRK: This is a new race. They offer other things of value besides
dilithium crystals. <br>
SPOCK: But we cannot expect their co-operation. They have refused the
Empire. Command procedure dictates that we provide the customary
example. <br>
SULU: Secondary target now moving beyond our phaser lock. <br>
KIRK: Put phasers on standby, Mister Sulu. <br>
SPOCK: A serious breach of orders, Captain. <br>
KIRK: I have my reasons, and I'll make them clear to you in my own good
time. <br>
UHURA: Captain, I have the leader on the Halkan Council waiting on
channel B. <br>
KIRK: It is useless to resist us. <br>
THARN [on viewscreen: We do not resist you. <br>
KIRK: You have twelve hours to consider your position. <br>
THARN [on viewscreen: Twelve years, Captain Kirk, or twelve thousand.
We are ethically compelled to deny your demand for our dilithium
crystals, for you would use their power to destroy. <br>
KIRK: We will level your planet and take what we want. That is
destruction. You will die as a race. <br>
THARN [on viewscreen: To preserve what we are. <br>
KIRK: We will not argue. Twelve hours. No more. Close communications.
Turn phasers off. <br>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Twelve hours, Captain? That is unprecedented. <br>
KIRK: I shall be in my quarters. Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy
and Mister Scott meet me there. <br>
(Chekov presses a couple of buttons on his console, then leaves his
post.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position. This
conduct must be reported. <br>

MCCOY: Here. Here. What's this? <br>
KIRK: It's called blood. Watch your step. The officers move up by
assassination. Chekov tried it on me. <br>
SCOTT: Mister Sulu is Security Chief, like the ancient Gestapo. <br>
MCCOY: And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors. My assistants were
betting on the tolerance of an injured man. How long it would take him
to pass out from the pain. <br>
KIRK: Report on technology. <br>
SCOTT: Mostly variations in instrumentation. Nothing I can't handle. <br>
KIRK: Star readings? <br>
SCOTT: Everything's exactly where it should be, except us. <br>
KIRK: Let's find out where we stand. Computer. <br>
COMPUTER: (a male voice) Ready. <br>
KIRK: This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified
under my voice print or Mister Scott's. <br>
COMPUTER: Recorded. <br>
KIRK: Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm. Correlate
following hypothesis. Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power
surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional
contact with a parallel universe? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
KIRK: At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of
beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
KIRK: Could conditions necessary to such an event be created
artificially using the ship's power? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
KIRK: Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it? <br>
SCOTT: Not by myself. I'll need help. And you'd be too conspicuous. <br>
MCCOY: I'm a doctor, not an engineer. <br>
SCOTT: Now you're an engineer. I'll have to tap the power we need from
the warp engines and balance it for the four of us. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in
this universe? <br>
KIRK: Let's find out. Computer. <br>
COMPUTER: Ready. <br>
KIRK: Read out official record of current command. <br>
COMPUTER: Captain James T. Kirk succeeded to command ISS Enterprise
through assassination of Captain Christopher Pike. First action,
suppression of Gorlan uprising through destruction of rebel home
planet. Second action, execution of five thousand colonists on Vega
Nine. <br>
KIRK: Cancel. Now we know. <br>
SCOTT: Captain? We can do it. <br>
KIRK: Good. <br>
SCOTT: We have to lay in the automatic transporter setting, but when we
interrupt engine circuits to tie the power increase into the
transporter, it'll show up on Sulu's security board. Of course, we'll
only need a second. <br>
KIRK: I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your
signal. Let's get back to our posts. Keep me advised. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing
back in our universe? <br>
KIRK: On our Enterprise. </font></p>

What is this? <br>
MCCOY2: What are you doing, Spock? <br>
KIRK2: You traitorous pig. I'll hang you up by your Vulcan ears. I'll

SPOCK: I think not. Your authority on this ship is extremely limited,
Captain. The four of you will remain her in the Brig and in custody

Where's your beard? What's going on? Where's my personal guard? <br>

credits, I'll give them to you. You'll be a rich man. A command of your
own? I can swing that, too. <br>

duties. I am frankly content to be a lesser target. <br>
KIRK: Logical, as always, Mister Spock. <br>

intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the
Halkans? <br>

behind his master.) <br>
KIRK: You heard my orders. <br>
SPOCK: They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire
procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences. <br>
KIRK: Is that a threat? <br>
SPOCK: I do not threaten, Captain. I merely state facts. I have found
you to be an excellent officer. Our missions together have been both
successful and profitable. However, I shall not permit your aberrations
to jeopardise my position. <br>
KIRK: Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans? <br>
SPOCK: Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the
logic of history. <br>
KIRK: Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more
than we can chew. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you
continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable
behaviour, <br>
KIRK: Is my concern, not yours. You would find me a formidable enemy. <br>

reverse. <br>

hundred? Now, I always thought that was funny, The great, powerful
Captain Kirk who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and a
plundered laboratory. <br>
KIRK: Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities <br>
MARLENA: You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher. <br>
(She switches it on, and Spock is seen sitting at his table.) <br>
MARLENA: That magnificent mind of his. But it can't protect him from
this. I press it and he dies. Now? <br>
(Kirk switches it off.) <br>
MARLENA: You really mean it. It doesn't matter. If Spock fails his
order, he'll be killed anyway. <br>
KIRK: I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear
him. <br>
MARLENA: You're not even afraid of Starfleet Command. Can your scheme
bring you that much power so quickly? And what about me? How does
Marlena fit in? <br>
KIRK: How does Marlena want to fit in? <br>
(She goes into the other room.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty. <br>

comfortable.) <br>
MARLENA: Oiling my traps, darling. I'm afraid I'm a little out of
practice. Maybe that's what happened to us? It's very hard for a
working officer to shine as a woman every minute, and you demand
perfection. <br>
KIRK: I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it.
<br>
MARLENA: I remember when you used to talk that way. <br>
KIRK: I still do. <br>
MARLENA: Prove it. <br>
KIRK: I've got to go. <br>
MARLENA: Ship's business? An important task on the crew deck? Well, I
guess it's over. Commander Kenno will take me temporarily. He's made
that quite clear. I'll call a yeoman to help me with my things. <br>
KIRK: You don't have to do that. <br>
MARLENA: Are you feeling sorry for me? Do I see hesitation in your eyes
about anything? I want one thing, Captain. Transfer me. On the
Enterprise, I am humiliated! On another ship, I can hunt fresh game.
I've got my rank, and. Don't I? I've been a captain's woman, and I like
it. I'll be one again if I have to go through every officer in the
fleet. <br>
KIRK: You could. (She turns to slap him.) I simply meant that you could
be anything you want to be. <br>
(They kiss, long and passionate.) <br>
MARLENA: It's been a long time since you've kissed me like that. You're
a stranger. Mercy to the Halkans, mercy to Spock, to me. Am I your
woman? <br>
KIRK: You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not. <br>

turbolift.)

KIRK: What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I
thought I had until dawn. <br>
SPOCK: I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet,
you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. I want to know
why. <br>
KIRK: Shoot. You're wasting time. <br>
SPOCK: I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too
disciplined once you've made up your mind. But Doctor McCoy has a
plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft. You may not tell me
what I want to know, but he will. <br>
KIRK: You're running a big risk, Spock. <br>

SCOTT: Hardly fifteen minutes, sir. The field density between the two

SULU: Mister Spock has orders to kill you, Captain. He will succeed,
apparently. You will also appear to have killed him after a fierce
battle. Regrettable, but it will leave me in command. <br>
(Then one of the henchmen disappears, and another. Marlena presses the
button again and Sulu is alone. Kirk disarms and knocks him out
easily.) <br>
SCOTT: Captain, we've barely got ten minutes. <br>
KIRK: Let's go, Bones. <br>

SCOTT: Aye, it's available. <br>
KIRK: Can you bridge to your setup? <br>
SCOTT: I can get us the power, but the automatic setting is linked to
the transporter main. If we bypass, that means that someone has got to
operate the controls manually. <br>

SPOCK: Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits. <br>
KIRK: You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I
shall operate the transporter. You have two minutes and ten seconds. <br>
KIRK: In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan
prediction of galactic revolt is realised? <br>
SPOCK: Approximately two hundred and forty years. <br>
KIRK: The inevitable outcome? <br>
SPOCK: The Empire shall be overthrown, of course. <br>
KIRK: The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives,
potential, resources, time. I submit to you that your Empire is
illogical because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to
be a willing part of it. <br>
SPOCK: You have one minute and twenty three seconds. <br>
KIRK: If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic
demand that you be a part of it? <br>
SPOCK: One man cannot summon the future. <br>
KIRK: But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this
Enterprise, Mister Spock. Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans
and make it stick. Push till it gives. You can defend yourself better
than any man in the fleet. <br>

to identify our counterparts so quickly? <br>
SPOCK: It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like
barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men. I assume
they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here. <br>
KIRK: Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I
read my Spocks correctly. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him
character. Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement.
<br>
KIRK: What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that
other universe. I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to
observe your counterparts here quite closely. They were brutal, savage,
unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples
of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity. I found them quite
refreshing. <br>

KIRK: Uh, why do you ask? <br>
SPOCK: Your reaction, One of recognition. <br>
KIRK: Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a
nice, likable girl. I think we could become friends. It's possible. <br>

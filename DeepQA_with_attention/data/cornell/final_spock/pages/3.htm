BALOK [OC]: And trespassed into our star systems. This is Balok,
Commander of the flagship Fesarius of the First Federation. Your
vessel, obviously the product of a primitive and savage civilisation,
having ignored a warning buoy and having then destroyed it, has
demonstrated your intention is not peaceful. We are now considering the
disposition of your ship and the life aboard.<br>
KIRK: Ship to ship.<br>
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.<br>
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning
nature of your space buoy was unknown to us. Our vessel was blocked.
When we attempted to disengage<br>
SPOCK: Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor
probes everywhere. Our electrical systems, our engines.<br>
BALOK [OC]: No further communication will be accepted. If there is the
slightest hostile move, your vessel will be destroyed immediately.<br>
SPOCK: They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant.
Extremely sophisticated in their methods.<br>
KIRK: Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?<br>
SPOCK: Enough to warn other Earth ships.<br>
KIRK: Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?<br>
BAILEY: Recorder marker dispatched, sir.<br>
SPOCK: Marker on course. Heading back the way we (big bang)<br>
BALOK [OC]: Your recorder marker has been destroyed. You have been
examined. Your ship must be destroyed. We make assumption you have a
deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you. We therefore
grant you ten Earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations.<br>
SPOCK: Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate
where that voice is coming from. (McCoy and Scott enter) <br>
MCCOY: Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.<br>
KIRK: Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this
vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger
facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's
no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden,
temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that
intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding
peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel
is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks
stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship.<br>
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.<br>
KIRK: This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking
friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our
goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We (humming
noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey.<br>
BAILEY: What? A course?<br>

escape. You have eight Earth minutes left.<br>

just sitting around. Somebody's got to do something.<br>
MCCOY: Easy, Bailey.<br>

mean?<br>

MCCOY: Let's go. (McCoy and Bailey leave) <br>
KIRK: Ship to ship.<br>
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.<br>
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom
of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We
destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we
attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our
species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be
true. (humming noise) <br>

them no harm. <br>
SPOCK: They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of

KIRK: Nobody's given up yet.<br>
MCCOY: Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records
as simple fatigue.<br>
KIRK: That's my decision, Doctor.<br>
MCCOY: And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too
much from him.<br>
KIRK: I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your
theories, your quaint philosophies.<br>
MCCOY: I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state
that I warned you about Bailey's condition. Now that's no bluff.<br>
KIRK: Any time you can bluff me, Doctor.<br>
BALOK [OC]: Three minutes.<br>
KIRK: All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not
chess, Mister Spock, poker. Do you know the game? Ship to ship.<br>
UHURA: Hailing frequencies open, sir.<br>
KIRK: This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other
lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of
information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of
any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth
vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite.
It is a material and a device which prevents attack on us. If any
destructive energy touches our vessel, a reverse reaction of equal
strength is created, destroying<br>
BALOK [OC]: You now have two minutes.<br>
KIRK: Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since
the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no
attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to
us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your
foolishness.<br>
SPOCK: However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more
about this Balok. In some manner he was reminiscent of my father.<br>
SCOTT: Then may heaven have helped your mother.<br>
SPOCK: Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate
Earth woman.<br>
KIRK: Doc. Sorry.<br>
MCCOY: For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the
devil you keep from punching me in the face.<br>
SULU: One minute. I knew he would. (Bailey enters) If anyone's
interested, thirty seconds.<br>
BAILEY: Request permission to return to post, sir.<br>
KIRK: Permission granted.<br>
SULU: Eleven, ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three,
two, one.<br>
SPOCK: A very interesting game, this poker.<br>
KIRK: It does have advantages over chess. <br>
MCCOY: Love to teach it to you.<br>
BALOK [OC]: This is the Commander of the Fesarius.<br>
KIRK: Here it comes. Is it raise or call?<br>
BALOK [OC]: The destruction of your vessel has been delayed. We will
relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite
device.<br>
KIRK: Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.<br>
UHURA: Hailing frequencies, sir.<br>
KIRK: Request denied.<br>
SPOCK: I have visual contact, Captain.<br>
BALOK [on viewscreen]: We will soon inform you of our decision
regarding your vessel. And having permitted your primitive efforts to
see my form, I trust it has pleased your curiosity. And now, another
demonstration of our superiority.<br>
MCCOY: I thought the power was off in the galley.<br>
RAND: I used a hand phaser, and zap. Hot coffee.<br>
SULU: Something's going on, Captain. (something leaves the Fesarius) <br>
KIRK: It's a small ship. <br>
SPOCK: About two thousand metric tons.<br>
BALOK [OC]: It has been decided that I will conduct you to a planet of
the First Federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform.
There you will disembark and be interned. Your ship will be destroyed,
of course.<br>
SPOCK: Engine systems coming on, Captain.<br>
BALOK [OC]: Do not be deceived by the size of this pilot vessel. It has
an equal potential to destroy your vessel.<br>
SPOCK: Tractor beam again.<br>
BALOK [OC]: So that you may sustain your gravity and atmosphere, your
systems are now open. Escape is impossible since you are being taken
under our power to your destination. Any move to escape or destroy this
ship will result in the instant destruction of the Enterprise and
everyone aboard.<br>

eight six. She'll blow soon!<br>
KIRK: Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two.<br>
BAILEY: We're breaking free, sir.<br>
KIRK: All engines stop.<br>
SULU: All engines stopped, sir.<br>
SCOTT: Engines need work badly, Captain. Can you hold it here a few
hours?<br>
SPOCK: That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.<br>
KIRK: Then we're not home yet.<br>
UHURA: A signal, Captain. It's very weak. It's Balok. It's a distress
signal to the Fesarius. His engines are out. His life-sustaining system
isn't operating. The message is repeating, sir.<br>
KIRK: Any reply?<br>
UHURA: Negative, sir. The signal is growing weak. Sir, I doubt if the
mother ship could have heard it.<br>
KIRK: Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey.<br>
SPOCK: For it, Captain?<br>
KIRK: Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel
is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake.
By our standards, alien life but lives nevertheless. Captain out.<br>
BAILEY: Course plotted and laid in, sir.<br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, ready the transporter room.<br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (leaves)<br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow.<br>
SULU: Ahead slow, sir.<br>
MCCOY: Jim, don't you think<br>
KIRK: What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and
contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our
high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me.
Doctor McCoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary, and you,
Mister Bailey.<br>
BAILEY: Sir?<br>
KIRK: The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.<br>
BAILEY: Yes, sir.<br>
SPOCK: Captain, request permission to<br>
KIRK: Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Transporter ready?<br>
SCOTT: Well, yes, sir, but it's risky. We're locked on what appears to
be a main deck.<br>
KIRK: Air sample?<br>
SCOTT: Breathable. In fact, a slightly higher oxygen content than our
own. Communicator, phaser weapon.<br>
KIRK: Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?<br>
MCCOY: No, but you won't let that stop you.<br>
SCOTT: Bend low, gentlemen. It reads pretty cramped over there. Ready
to transport.<br>
KIRK: Energise.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Balok's ship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.<br>
BALOK: I'm Balok. Welcome aboard. (curtain opens to reveal a small
humanoid with big grin)<br>
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. <br>
BALOK: And McCoy and Bailey. Sit. Be comfortable. Go ahead, be seated.
We must drink. This is tranya. I hope you relish it as much as I.<br>
KIRK: Commander Balok.<br>
BALOK: I know, I know, a thousand questions. But first, the tranya.
Gentlemen. (drinks) Ahh.<br>
KIRK: Commander, that puppet.<br>
BALOK: My alter ego, so to speak. In your culture, he would be Mister
Hyde to my Jekyll. You must admit he's effective. You would never have
been frightened by me. And I thought my distress signal quite clever.
It was a pleasure testing you.<br>
BAILEY: Testing us?<br>
KIRK: I see.<br>
BALOK: I had to discover your real intentions.<br>
KIRK: But you probed our memory banks.<br>
BALOK: Your records could have been a deception on your part.<br>
MCCOY: And your crew?<br>
BALOK: I have no crew, Doctor. I run everything, this entire complex,
from this small ship. But I miss company, conversation. Even an alien
would be welcome. Perhaps one of your men for some period of time. An
exchange of information, cultures.<br>
KIRK: Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can
find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?<br>
BAILEY: Me, sir. I'd like to volunteer.<br>
BALOK: Ah. You represent Earth's best, then.<br>
BAILEY: No, sir, I'm not. I'll make plenty of mistakes. <br>
KIRK: But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better
officer in return.<br>
BALOK: (laughs) I see. We think much alike, Captain, you and I. Now,
before I bring back the Fesarius, let me show you my vessel. It is not
often I have this pleasure. Yes, we're very much alike, Captain. Both
proud of our ships. </font> </p>

Captain's Log, stardate 2821.5. On route to Makus Three with a cargo of
medical supplies. Our course leads us past Murasaki 312, a quasar-like
formation, vague, undefined. A priceless opportunity for scientific
investigation. On board is Galactic High Commissioner Ferris,
overseeing the deliver of the medicines to Makus Three. </font>

Mister Spock. <br>
FERRIS: I remind you, Captain, I'm entirely opposed to this delay. Your
mission is to get those emergency medical supplies to Makus Three in
time for their transfer to the New Paris colonies. <br>
KIRK: No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have
standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena
wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus.
And the rendezvous doesn't take place for five. <br>
FERRIS: I don't like to take chances. The plague is out of control on
New Paris. We must get those drugs there on time. <br>
KIRK: No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off.

disruptive. Just how much, we don't know. <br>
SPOCK: Considerably, Mister Boma. <br>

SULU: Scanners are blank, Captain. We're getting a mass of readings
I've never seen. Nothing makes sense. <br>

COMPUTER: Negative ionic concentration one point six four times ten to
the ninth power metres, Radiation wave length three hundred seventy
angstroms. Harmonics upward along entire spectrum. <br>
FERRIS: What is it, Captain? <br>
KIRK: That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of
our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the
immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot
shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a
haystack would be child's play. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Log, stardate 2821.7. The electromagnetic
phenomenon known as Murasaki Three Twelve whirls like some angry blight
in space, a depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not
been heard from. Equally bad, the effect has rendered our normal
searching systems useless. Without them, we are blind and almost
helpless. </font></p>

FERRIS: I was opposed to this from the very beginning. Our flight to
Makus Three is of the very highest priority. <br>
KIRK: I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain
scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect
is one. <br>
FERRIS: Yes, but you've lost your crew. <br>
KIRK: We have two days to find them. <br>
FERRIS: Two days? ln all that? Two days? <br>
KIRK: What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there? <br>
FERRIS: You shouldn't have sent them out in the first place. <i>Do you know what you've done? You've 
concerned yourself with only seven people. </i><br>
UHURA: Captain, there's one planet in this solar system capable of
sustaining human life. It's type M, oxygen, nitrogen, and it's listed
as Taurus Two. It's unexplored. As far as we can determine with our
equipment malfunction, it's just about dead-centre of the Murasaki
effect. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Set course for Taurus Two. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>

GAETANO: (Holding his right wrist) Yes. <br>
MCCOY: Scotty? Boma? <br>
BOMA: Now that's what I call a ride. <br>
MCCOY: Yeoman? <br>
MEARS: Yes. I just got a little bump on the head. <br>
MCCOY: (helping her back into her seat) Upsy-daisy. <br>
MEARS: Thank you. <br>
MCCOY: What happened? <br>
BOMA: I can't be sure, but I'd say that, the magnetic potential of the
effect was (McCoy gives him a tissue for his nose bleed) Thank you. Was
such that, as we gathered speed, it was multiplied geometrically. And
we were simply shot into the centre of the effect. Like a projectile. <br>
SPOCK: I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma. <br>
SCOTT: What a mess. <br>
SPOCK: Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister
Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to
Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. <br>
SCOTT: You don't really expect to get an answer, do you? <br>
SPOCK: I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all
the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please. <br>
MCCOY: Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury.
Nitrogen one forty. Breathable, if you're not running in competition. <br>
SPOCK: Just the facts, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities.
However, I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer resort. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're
recording this, Yeoman? <br>
MEARS: Of course, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please. <br>
SCOTT: Logical. <br>
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister
Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm
yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the
ship. <br>
LATIMER: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
(The two men go outside, and the doors close behind them) <br>
MCCOY: What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise? <br>
SPOCK: Under present conditions, extremely poor. <br>
MCCOY: But they'll be looking for us. <br>
SPOCK: If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is,
Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual
contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet. <br>
MCCOY: Then you don't think they'll find us. <br>
SPOCK: Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long
time, Doctor. </font></p>

KIRK: Anything on your scanners? <br>
SULU: Totally inoperative, sir. No readings at all. <br>
KIRK: Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. No change. <br>
KIRK: Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the
transporters beaming up yet? <br>
CHIEF [OC]: Not one hundred percent, Captain. We beamed down some inert
material, but it came back in a disassociated condition. We wouldn't
dare try with people. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare
Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface.
Correlate co-ordinates with Mister Sulu. Thank you. Anything, Uhura? <br>
UHURA: All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir.
Transmission is blocked, reception impossible. <br>
FERRIS: Well, Captain? <br>
KIRK: We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner. <br>
FERRIS: You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you? <br>
KIRK: Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to
continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment. <br>
FERRIS: Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment. Is
that clear? If it isn't, I suggest you look at book nineteen, section
four thirty three, paragraph twelve. <br>

MCCOY: Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's
your big chance. <br>
SPOCK: My big chance? For what, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it,
but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to
build command. Am I right? <br>
SPOCK: I am a logical man, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: It'll take more than logic to get us out of this. <br>
SPOCK: Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise
command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as
these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of
it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be
done.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Very bad, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: In what way? <br>
SCOTT: We've lost a great deal of fuel. We have no chance at all to
reach escape velocity. And if we ever hope to make orbit, we'll have to
lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds. <br>
SPOCK: The weight of three grown men. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, you could put it that way. <br>
MCCOY: Or the equivalent weight in equipment. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every
piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very
little excess weight, except among the passengers. <br>
BOMA: You mean three of us must stay behind. <br>
SPOCK: Unless the situation changes radically, yes. <br>
BOMA: And who's to choose? <br>
SPOCK: As commanding officer, the choice will be mine. <br>
BOMA: You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots? <br>
SPOCK: A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better
qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots. <br>
BOMA: All right, Mister Spock. Who? <br>
SPOCK: My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical
means. <br>
MCCOY: Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical. <br>
SPOCK: But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I
suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in
the event we've overlooked any minor damage. <br>

BOMA: If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head
together. <br>

BOMA: Sir? <br>
SPOCK: There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered
in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more
crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient. <br>

BOMA: You? Error? Impossible. <br>
SPOCK: Then what, Mister Boma? <br>
BOMA: There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears.
What about Latimer? <br>
SPOCK: My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister
Boma. <br>

should leave his body here. <br>

KIRK: Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every
lap from now on. <br>
SULU: But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a
dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop. <br>

tribal culture. <br>
SPOCK: Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More
likely a loose association of some sort. <br>

twice about attacking us. <br>

them an invitation to come down and slaughter us. <br>

than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its
search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after
that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying

Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please. <br>

MCCOY: I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he
finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell
me. <br>

MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did
they? <br>
SPOCK: Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.
They should have fled. <br>
MCCOY: You mean they should have respected us? <br>
SPOCK: Of course. <br>
MCCOY: Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur
to you they might react emotionally, with anger? <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. <br>
MCCOY: They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You
might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them
down on us. <br>

SPOCK: Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile. <br>
BOMA: My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock! <br>
SPOCK: Curious. Most illogical. <br>

SPOCK: I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated
resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than
the whole. <br>
MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need,
Mister Spock. <br>

Maybe you can explain it to me. Logically, of course.

virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would
seem to me to be an act of desperation. <br>
SPOCK: Quite correct, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that
desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your
well-known logic explain that? <br>
SPOCK: Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles,
and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the
circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of
desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at. <br>
KIRK: I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional
outburst. <br>
SPOCK: Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but
those are essentially the facts. <br>
KIRK: You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life,
you committed a purely human emotional act? <br>
SPOCK: No, sir. <br>

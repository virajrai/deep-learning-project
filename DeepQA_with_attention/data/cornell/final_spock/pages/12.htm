FARRELL: I've answered it on all frequencies, sir. They don't reply. <br>
SPOCK: Not a vessel, a ground source. The third planet in this solar
system, according to my instruments. <br>
FARRELL: Directly ahead. Definitely an Earth-style signal. <br>
KIRK: We're hundreds of light years from Earth, Mister Spock. No
colonies or vessels out this far. <br>
SPOCK: Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped,
circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles.
Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons. Mean density five
point five one seven. Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen. <br>
RAND: Earth! <br>
KIRK: Not the Earth, another Earth. Another Earth?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Log, stardate 2713.5. In the distant
reaches of our galaxy, we have made an astonishing discovery. Earth
type radio signals coming from a planet which apparently is an exact
duplicate of the Earth. It seems impossible, but there it is.

SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Still no response, communications? <br>
FARRELL: None, Captain. <br>
KIRK: We'll beam down. Alert security. Prepare to transport landing
party to surface. We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals
now being received.

1900s. <br>
SPOCK: More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately
1960. <br>
RAND: But where is everybody? <br>
SPOCK: Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking
place on this planet for at least several centuries. <br>
RAND: You mean there's no one alive? <br>
SPOCK: Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the
distress signal is automated. <br>
MCCOY: Now, this is marvellous. the most horrible conglomeration of
antique architecture I've ever seen. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. (comes upon child's tricycle) <br>
TEENAGER: Mine! Mine! (attacks McCoy) Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! (Kirk drags him off and hits him several times) It's, it's broke.
Somebody broke it. Fix. Somebody, please fix. <br>
MCCOY: Of course somebody will fix it. <br>
SPOCK: Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion. <br>
KIRK: But with the mind of a child. Bones, what is it? <br>
MCCOY: A seizure of some type. <br>
KIRK: We want to help you. <br>
TEENAGER: Liar! Fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber, fibber! <br>
MCCOY: It's dead. It's incredible. <br>
KIRK: What is? <br>
MCCOY: Its metabolic rate. It's impossibly high as if it's burning
itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes.

KIRK: Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings,
chemical pollutions, any further sign of life. <br>
SPOCK: Right, Captain. <br>
MCCOY: I wonder what happened to her, that she should be so terrified
of us. <br>
(Someone clears a patch of grime from a window, Spock goes over and
peers in) <br>
MIRI: But I remember the things you Grups did, burning, yelling,
hurting people. <br>
KIRK: We didn't do anything like that. <br>
MIRI: You're not going to hurt? <br>
KIRK: Well, of course not. We're here to help. <br>
MIRI: Grups don't help. <br>
RAND: But we will. <br>
KIRK: What happened here? Where is everybody? <br>
MIRI: You know. <br>
KIRK: No, I don't. Won't you tell me? <br>
MIRI: You got a foolie, is that it, and you want me to play, but I
can't. I don't know the rules. I've got to know the rules. <br>
MCCOY: Foolie? <br>
MIRI: A game, you know. You can't play a game without rules. Even Grups
ought to know that. <br>
KIRK: What are Grups? <br>
MIRI: You are. They will, when Onlies get old. <br>
RAND: Grownups. <br>
KIRK: You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling,
hurting, burning. <br>
MIRI: That was when they started to get sick in the before time. We
hid, then they were gone. Am I doing all right? <br>
KIRK: You're doing fine. <br>
MCCOY: You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of
them around? <br>
MIRI: Yes. They died, but that was after the awful things. <br>
MCCOY: A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it. <br>
KIRK: But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things
affect them? <br>
MIRI: Of course not. We're here, aren't we? <br>
KIRK: More of you? How many? <br>
MIRI: All there are. <br>
KIRK: What's your name? <br>
MIRI: Miri. <br>
KIRK: Miri. A pretty name for a pretty young woman. <br>
MIRI: Pretty? <br>
KIRK: Very pretty.

begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like
animals. Only children. <br>
KIRK: Miri said all the adults died. <br>
MCCOY: That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps
it died of the disease the girl's talking about. <br>
KIRK: There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our
questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to
work? <br>
MIRI: Yes, I know that. Them and their pills and things. <br>
KIRK: Will you take me there? <br>
MIRI: That's a bad place. <br>
KIRK: It's important. Please. <br>
MIRI: All right. Do you have a name, too? <br>
KIRK: Yes. It's Jim. <br>
MIRI: I like that name. <br>
KIRK: Good. I like yours, too. I like you. <br>
MIRI: Do you really? <br>
KIRK: I wouldn't lie to you. <br>
MIRI: I wouldn't lie to you, either, Jim. I remember the Grups, but
you're nice. You're different. <br>
KIRK: Why, thank you. (sees a mark on his hand) <br>
MIRI: It's already starting. I knew it would. Just like it did with the
Grups. It'll spread all over you, and you'll yell, and you'll try to
hurt everybody and then you'll die. I knew it would! I knew it would!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Log, stardate 2713.6. The building Miri
led us to also housed an automatic transmission station, which sent out
the signal that drew us to this planet. We also discovered something
else. That the blues
blotches, characteristic of the unknown disease had appeared on each of
us, with the exception of Mister Spock. There was a well-equipped
laboratory in the building.
Doctor McCoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate
the organism responsible.

KIRK: My orders still stand, Lieutenant. You can help us best by
clearing the computer banks and standing by. Kirk out. Bones, why do
you think the symptoms haven't appeared in Mister Spock? <br>
MCCOY: I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have
no appetite for green blood. <br>
SPOCK: Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now
there you have a museum piece, Doctor. (referring to microscope) Lens
type, manually operated, light-activated. <br>
MCCOY: Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please. It is enough that
it works. <br>
MIRI: It spreads real fast. I know. When you're old, it covers you like
anything. <br>
KIRK: (reading) Intermediate experimentation report project on life
prolongation. <br>
SPOCK: Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Tubular with extreme multiplicability.
Appear to have affinity for nucleic acids. Give me what you have. <br>
SPOCK: This was three hundred years ago, Captain. <br>
KIRK: All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive. <br>
SPOCK: But children become adults. <br>
KIRK: At least they have up to now. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place
upon entering puberty, are there not? <br>
MCCOY: Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of
course you know that. Why? <br>
SPOCK: Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter
puberty, contract the disease? <br>
KIRK: That would explain why there are no adults. <br>
MCCOY: Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be. <br>
SPOCK: It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this
planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the
streets. <br>
KIRK: Who die when they enter adolescence. <br>
MCCOY: But how do they keep the line going? <br>
RAND: One thing, Captain. If she were a wild animal ever since she's
been a little girl, how do you explain that she wants to stay with us? <br>
KIRK: Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an
instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong. <br>
SPOCK: There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain. <br>
MCCOY: She likes you, Jim. <br>

FARRELL [OC]: Here are those figures you asked for. Twelve to the tenth
power. Metabolic rate seventy two percent. Production of nucleic acids
reduced to thirty three percent of normal. Conventional chronological
progression one hundred by three point six. <br>
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. <br>
KIRK: (to redshirts) Try again. See if you can find anything outside.
(to Miri) Hey, clean up that desk for me, will you? <br>
MIRI: All right, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. <br>
SPOCK: According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought
they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every
one hundred years of real time. <br>
RAND: One hundred years and only one month? <br>
SPOCK: Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this
virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period,
leaving only the children. <br>
RAND: But that means these children <br>
SPOCK: Could very well be immensely old. <br>
KIRK: That would certainly answer the question of what happened to
their parents. <br>
MCCOY: Answers it very well. <br>
RAND: Children who never age. Eternal childhood, filled with play, no
responsibilities. It's almost like a dream. <br>
KIRK: I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not
turn out to be very pretty. <br>
MCCOY: A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us
could have been just like Miri. A child entering puberty on this planet
means a death sentence. <br>
RAND: Do you suppose she knows? <br>
KIRK: I don't think so. <br>
RAND: If they're as old as Spock claims, they must have some idea of
what's happening. <br>
KIRK: There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with
children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children.
We've got to do something about the others. <br>
SPOCK: Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. <br>
KIRK: You couldn't get close to the other kids? <br>
SPOCK: Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. <br>
KIRK: I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with
me? <br>
MIRI: Sure. (leave, holding hands) <br>
RAND: That little girl <br>
SPOCK: Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman.

JAHN: I don't, I don't know. I know what we've got to do. There are
more of them than we see. Somewhere, up in the sky, maybe, somewhere.
They talk to each other all the time. You know Grups. You know what
they do, the hurting, the killing. <br>
RED HEAD BOY: I remember, Jahn, the way it was. <br>
JAHN: That's right, the way it was in the before time. They talk to the
other Grups with these little boxes. Now, if they didn't have those
little boxes, they'd be all alone, huh? <br>

flee, screaming. The girl jumps Kirk, and he eventually stuns her) <br>

MIRI: No, I don't mind. <br>
KIRK: There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here? <br>
SPOCK: This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the
disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was
too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree,
but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we
have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. <br>
MCCOY: Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other,
till the last of us finally destroys himself. <br>
KIRK: What about Miri? <br>
SPOCK: Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter
puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it
doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five
or six weeks left. <br>
MCCOY: What about us? <br>
SPOCK: The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the
disease. <br>
KIRK: And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you. <br>
SPOCK: I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship,
and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting.
<br>
MCCOY: No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's
progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great
pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the
early symptoms. There'll be more. <br>

chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the
human cell immeasurably. <br>
SPOCK: Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: It looks right. <br>
SPOCK: The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. <br>
MCCOY: But the question is, what's the dosage? <br>
SPOCK: That is a very good question. <br>
KIRK: Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice? <br>
MIRI: What's the matter with you? How should I know? <br>
KIRK: Where is she? Has something happened to her? <br>
MIRI: Don't you feel all right? <br>
KIRK: No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you
see what's going on? <br>
MIRI: Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you. <br>
KIRK: I've got to find Janice. <br>
SPOCK: That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. <br>
KIRK: We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard. <br>
MCCOY: That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it
without the ship's computers. <br>
SPOCK: We've got to have those communicators, Jim. <br>
KIRK: This is the vaccine? <br>
MCCOY: That's what the computers will tell us. <br>
SPOCK: Without them, it could be a beaker full of death. <br>
KIRK: Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left. <br>
MIRI: I don't care. <br>
KIRK: You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You,
your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we
succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it. <br>
MIRI: Sometimes it happens. <br>
KIRK: Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing
up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games
anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's
because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a
young woman, you get the disease. All of you. <br>
MIRI: That's not true. It just happens sometimes. <br>
KIRK: All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it.
Look at it, Miri, it's in you! <br>
MIRI: No! No! No!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RED HEAD BOY: Blah, blah, blah! <br>
JAHN: No, you got the wrong game. A teacher, I told you. Now, what does
a teacher say, huh? <br>
RED HEAD BOY: Yeah. Study, study, study, or bonk bonk, bad kid.
(children all applaud) <br>
RAND: It's not funny. <br>
JAHN: It's a foolie. <br>
RAND: What are you going to do with me? <br>
JAHN: You think I'd tell you? Miri, you're not supposed to be here. <br>
MIRI: I know. <br>
JAHN: What's the matter, something go wrong? <br>
MIRI: No. <br>
JAHN: Okay, then. Don't just stand there in the doorway, come on in. <br>
MIRI: Listen to him. <br>
JAHN: You listen, Miri. <br>
MIRI: I did. Why do you think I brought him here? Tell them, Jim. <br>
JAHN: Tell'em, Jim. Tell'em, Jim. <br>
CHILDREN: Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! Tell'em, Jim! <br>
KIRK: Listen to me. Listen to me! <br>
JAHN: No yelling in the classroom! Look at him, a very bad citizen. <br>
KIRK: This isn't a game. It never was a game. <br>
BLONDE GIRL: Call the police! <br>
RED HEAD BOY: I'm the police. Bonk bonk unless you're good. <br>
JAHN: You're the teacher. <br>
RED HEAD BOY: I got two jobs. Bonk bonk! <br>
CHILDREN: Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah
blah! <br>
KIRK: Listen to me! You've got our communicators, the boxes we talk
into. We need them to talk to the ship. <br>
RED HEAD BOY: Blah blah blah! <br>
KIRK: No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you
don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be
anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever. <br>
RAND: (sees boy with club coming up behind him) Captain. <br>
KIRK: Now listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let
Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late. <br>
CHILDREN: (approaching menacingly) Nyah na nyah, nyah na nyah, nyah na
nyah, nyah na nyah. <br>
KIRK: You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up. Did
you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease,
and they became like,
Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they
changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has.
You understand what I'm talking about. You're not babies. We can help
you! <br>
RED HEAD BOY: Naughty Grup. (starts hitting Kirk) Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk!
<br>
MIRI: No, please. No! (the other children join in as the little blonde
girl watches, smiling) <br>
KIRK: (bleeding) It's waiting for you. It may only be a matter of
months. <br>
MIRI: Listen to him. He's telling the truth. <br>
JAHN: He's funny. He thinks he's funny. <br>
RED HEAD BOY: Bonk bonk! Get him! <br>
KIRK: Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you
let me help you. <br>
RED HEAD BOY: Bonk bonk! Hit him! <br>
KIRK: And the little ones. What's going to happen to them after you've
gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? Oh, they'll still
be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten
it. Maybe six months left, that's all,
and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll
die, too. <br>
MIRI: Look at my arm, Jahn. It's happening to me. He's telling the
truth. <br>
JAHN: They're Grups! <br>
CHILDREN: Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk! <br>
KIRK: All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I
double-dare you. Look at the blood on my face. Now look at your hands.
Blood on your hands. Now who's doing the hurting? Not the Grups, it's
you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups you remember
and creatures you're afraid of. You're acting like them, and you're
going to be just like them unless you let me help you. I'm a Grup, and
I want to help you. I'm begging you, let me help you or there won't be
anything left at all. Please. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: We can't wait for those communicators any
longer. <br>
SPOCK: We must. The vaccine could be fatal. <br>
MCCOY: The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours,
minutes? How much longer do you want to wait? <br>
SPOCK: Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.
<br>
(Spock leaves. McCoy picks up the hypospray and injects himself, then
collapses in agony) <br>
MCCOY: Spock! <br>
GALLOWAY: Is he dead, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Not yet. <br>
KIRK: (with children and communicators) Three hours, eleven minutes
left. Thank you, Lieutenant. Keep this channel open. Clear your
computers. What happened to him? <br>
SPOCK: He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I
found him. <br>
KIRK: Look at his face. <br>
SPOCK: The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand
the medical mind? <br>
JAHN: Is this supposed to be a good thing, Miri? <br>
MIRI: Of course it is.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAND: They were just children. Simply to leave them
there with a medical team <br>
KIRK: Just children, three hundred years old and more. I've already
contacted Space Central. They'll send teachers, advisers. <br>
MCCOY: And truant officers, I presume. <br>
KIRK: They'll be all right. <br>
RAND: Miri. She really loved you, you know. <br>
KIRK: Yes. I never get involved with older women, Yeoman. Mister Spock?
<br>
SPOCK: Captain? <br>
KIRK: Full ahead. Warp factor one. <br>
SPOCK: Warp factor one, Captain. </font> </p>

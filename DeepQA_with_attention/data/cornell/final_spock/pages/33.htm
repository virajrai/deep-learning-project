Captain. This entire system has been almost the same. A strange lack of
intelligent life on the planets. It bugs the percentages. <br>
KIRK: Bugs the? Well, carry out the standard procedures on Pollux Four.
<br>
CAROLYN: Aye, sir. <br>
MCCOY: Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning. <br>
CAROLYN: Well, I was up all night working on this report, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Well in that case, there's nothing like a wee bit of coffee to
get you back in shape. Join me, Carolyn? <br>
CAROLYN: All right, Scotty. Just let me give this to Mister Spock. <br>
KIRK: Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee? <br>
MCCOY: Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up. <br>
SCOTT: Gentlemen. Come along, my dear. <br>
MCCOY: I'm not sure I like that, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Why, Bones? Scotty's a good man. <br>
MCCOY: And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she
thinks he's the right man. On the other hand, she's a woman. All woman.
One day she'll find the right man and off she'll go, out of the
service. <br>

CHEKOV: Entering standard orbit around Pollux Four, sir. <br>
KIRK: Cartographic Detail, stand by. <br>
UHURA: Standing by, sir. <br>
KIRK: Preliminary reports, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Pollux Four. Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen
atmosphere. Sensors indicate no life forms. Approximate age four
billion years. Judged no reason for contact. In all respects, quite
ordinary, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Cartographic Sections, implement standard orders. <br>
UHURA: All cartographic standards full automatic. <br>
SULU: Captain? <br>
MCCOY: What in the name of? <br>
(Where there was originally an image of a nice blue and white planet
there is now a .... hand?) <br>
KIRK: Analysis, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Momentarily. <br>
CHEKOV: Am I seeing things? <br>
SULU: Not unless I am, too. Captain, that thing's a giant hand. <br>
KIRK: What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Not living tissue. <br>
KIRK: A trick, then? A projection? <br>
SPOCK: Not a projection, sir. A field of energy. <br>
KIRK: Hard about. <br>
SULU: Hard about. We can't seem to get away from it. <br>
UHURA: It's almost as if it means to grab us. <br>
KIRK: Reverse all engines. <br>
SULU: All engines reverse. <br>
(Everyone is thrown forward as the ship is grabbed by the hand and
stopped in its tracks.) <br>
SULU: We're dead still, Captain. Helm doesn't answer. We can't move.

circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and
back. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
UHURA: Damage report coming in, Captain. Situation under control. Minor
damage, stations three, seven, and nineteen. <br>
MCCOY: Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu? <br>
SULU: Applying thrust, sir. No results, Captain. We're stuck tight. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. Status. <br>
SPOCK: The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It
resembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths.
Despite its appearance, that of a human appendage, it is definitely not
living tissue. It is energy. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu. Our forward tractor beams, adjust to
repel. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. Standing by. <br>
KIRK: Activate. <br>
SULU: Ineffective, Captain. There doesn't seem to be anything to push
against. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven. <br>
KIRK: Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Screen on, Captain. <br>
(Now a face appears in space, a male human wearing a laurel wreath.) <br>
UHURA: Activity on hailing channel three, sir. <br>
KIRK; Put it on audio, Lieutenant. <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: The eons have passed and what has been written
has come about. You are most welcome, my beloved children. Your places
await you. <br>
KIRK: Response frequencies, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Calculated. Channel open, sir. <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: You have left your plains and valleys and made
this bold venture. So it was in the beginning. You have made me proud.
Now you can rest. <br>
KIRK: This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise.
Please identify yourself. <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: We shall remember together. We shall drink the
sacramental wine. There shall be the music of the pipes. The long wait
has ended. <br>
KIRK: Are you responsible for stopping the ship? <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: Yes. I caused the wind to withdraw from your
sails. <br>
KIRK: Give it back, then we'll talk. <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: It has been five thousand years. Have you
learned no patience in that time? <br>
KIRK: I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the
power to defend ourselves. If you value your safety, release this ship.
<br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: You have the same fire. How like your fathers
you are. Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. <br>
KIRK: Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship! <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: You will obey me, lest I close my hand thus. <br>
SCOTT: External pressure building up, Captain. Eight hundred GSC and
climbing. <br>
KIRK: Compensate. <br>
SCOTT: One thousand GSC and climbing. (The crew react to increasing air
pressure) Becoming critical, Captain. We can't handle it. <br>
KIRK: All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win! <br>
SCOTT: Pressure is gone, Captain. Space normal on hull. <br>
APOLLO [on viewscreen]: hat was your first lesson. Remember it. Captain
Kirk, I invite you and your officers to join me. But do not bring that
one, the one with the pointed ears. He is much like Pan, and Pan always
bored me. No sad faces. This is a time to rejoice, not to fear. You are
returning home. Let your hearts prepare to sing. <br>
KIRK: Let's go, Bones. You in good voice? <br>
MCCOY: Sure it's wise, Jim? <br>
KIRK: If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell
where this ship used to be. <br>
SPOCK: Verbose, isn't he? <br>
KIRK: Insulted, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Insults are effective only where emotion is present. <br>
KIRK: Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions.
You're the best man to find the answers. </font></p>

beam down into a lightly wooded area in front of a Greek temple.) <br>
KIRK: Tricorders. <br>
CAROLYN: What am I doing down here, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you? Archaeology,
anthropology, ancient civilisations. <br>
CAROLYN: Correct. <br>
MCCOY: We're going to need help in all those areas. <br>
KIRK: Come on. <br>
(Apollo is sitting on a throne, lyre by his feet) <br>
APOLLO: My children, long have I waited for this moment. The memories
you bring of your lush and beautiful Earth, the green fields and blue
skies, the simple shepherds and their flocks. <br>
KIRK: You know of Earth? You've been there? <br>
APOLLO: Once I stretched out my hand, and Earth trembled. And I
breathed upon it, and spring returned. <br>
KIRK: You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. How do you know about
them? <br>
APOLLO: Search your most distant memories, those of the thousands of
years past, and I am there. Your fathers knew me, and your father's
fathers. I am Apollo. <br>
CHEKOV: And I am the tsar of all the Russias. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: I'm sorry, Captain. I never met a god before. <br>
KIRK: And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Simple humanoid, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Evidently not so simple. <br>
APOLLO: Earth, mother of the most beautiful of women in the universe.
That at least has not changed. I am pleased. Yes, my children.
Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis. A gallant band of travellers. We knew
your Earth well, five thousand of your years ago. <br>
KIRK: All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling
us what you want without all the Olympian generalities? <br>
APOLLO: You will not leave this place. <br>
KIRK: Transporter room. <br>
APOLLO: Your transportation device no longer functions. <br>
KIRK: Enterprise, come in. <br>
APOLLO: I will not permit that device to work, either, Captain. <br>
KIRK: What is it you want? <br>
APOLLO: You will worship me, as your fathers did before you. <br>
KIRK: If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your
business, but you're no god to us, Mister. <br>
APOLLO: I said you would worship me. <br>
KIRK: And you've got a lot to learn! <br>
APOLLO: And so have you! Let the lesson begin! (Apollo grows as tall as
his temple.) Welcome to Olympus, Captain Kirk. </font></p>

UHURA: Mister Spock, I can't contact the landing party. All frequencies
are jammed. <br>
SPOCK: Try to break through it, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KYLE: Transporter and communications? <br>
SPOCK: Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for
maximum power generation. Compute for reversal of polarity of the field
around the ship. <br>
SULU: Working, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet. <br>
KYLE: Aye sir. <br>
SPOCK: Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down
there. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The giant Apollo suddenly looks weary, and
vanishes.) <br>
MCCOY: To coin a phrase, fascinating. <br>
KIRK: Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo? <br>
CAROLYN: Apollo, twin brother of Artemis, son of the god Zeus and Leto,
a mortal. He was the god of light and purity. He was skilled in the bow
and lyre. <br>
KIRK: And this thing? (the temple) <br>
CAROLYN: Obviously he has some knowledge of Earth. His classical
references and the appearance of all this. <br>
KIRK: I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones? <br>
MCCOY: I can't say much till I check our these readings. He looks
human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing. <br>
CHEKOV: Whatever he is, he seems to control a remarkable technology. <br>
SCOTT: Power is what he controls. You can't do tricks like that without
energy. <br>
KIRK: Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your
tricorders. Find the source of that power. Bones. <br>
(Scott, Chekov and Carolyn wander off.) <br>
MCCOY: Yes? <br>
KIRK: Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago <br>
MCCOY: You have a theory? <br>
KIRK: I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo? <br>
MCCOY: What? <br>
CAROLYN: Captain. <br>
(Apollo is back on his throne.) <br>
APOLLO: I want from you that which is rightfully mine. Your loyalty,
your tribute, and your worship. <br>
MCCOY: May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship? <br>
APOLLO: Life in paradise. As simple and as pleasureful as it was those
thousands of years ago on that beautiful planet so far away. <br>
KIRK: Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to
every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks. <br>
APOLLO: Agamemnon was one such as you, and Hercules. Pride and
arrogance. They defied me until they felt my wrath. <br>
SCOTT: I would like to point out that we are quite capable of some
wrath ourselves. <br>
KIRK: I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there. <br>
APOLLO: No, you do not, Captain. They are mine. To save, to cherish, or
to destroy at my will. <br>
CAROLYN: But why? What you've said so far makes no sense at all. <br>
APOLLO: How like Aphrodite and Athena. The beauty, grace. And you seem
wise for a woman. What is your name? <br>
CAROLYN: Lieutenant Palamas. <br>
APOLLO: I mean your name. <br>
CAROLYN: Carolyn. <br>
APOLLO: Carolyn. Yes. You are beautiful. You would do Aphrodite credit.
I will tell you a thousand tales, stories of courage and love. You will
know what it is to be a goddess. <br>
SCOTT: Leave her alone. <br>
APOLLO: You protest? You risk much. <br>
SCOTT: And so do you. <br>
(Scott draws his phaser and Apollo blasts it out of his hand with a
point of his finger. Chekov finds his phaser doesn't work.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty. (picks up the twisted and melted weapon) Very impressive.
How'd you do it? <br>
APOLLO: I've grown weary of discussion and argument. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, the phasers. All the working parts are fused. <br>
APOLLO: None of your toys will function. Yes. You are a beauty. But
like Artemis, the bow arm should be bare. <br>
(He waves his hand and her clothes turn into Greek-style draperies,
with her hair piled very tall.) <br>
CAROLYN: Oh, it's beautiful. <br>
APOLLO: Yes. Come. (he takes her hand and leads her away) <br>
SCOTT: She's not going with you. <br>
(Scott gets thrown over a table with a flick of the wrist.) <br>
APOLLO: He shall learn the discipline of the temple. So shall you all.
Come. <br>
CAROLYN: It's all right, Captain. I'll go. <br>
APOLLO: Without fear. She is fit indeed. <br>
(They both vanish as they walk away.) <br>
KIRK: Bones, how is he? <br>
MCCOY: Stunned but coming around. I'm not sure it's wise to let her go
off like that. <br>
KIRK: He would have been rather difficult to stop. <br>
MCCOY: You saw how capricious he is. Benevolent one minute, angry the
next. One more wrong move from her and he could kill her. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
(leaves) <br>
KIRK: How do you feel, Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: I am tingling all over. Did he take her with him? <br>
KIRK: It would seem so. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, we've got to stop him. He wants her. The way he looks
at her. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she
volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him. She's
doing her job. I think it's about time you started doing yours. We've
got to find out the source of his power. You've got a tricorder. Use it
if you're able to. <br>
SCOTT: I'm able, sir. <br>
KIRK: And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against
Apollo or whatever he is. That's an order! <br>
SCOTT: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten
yourself killed. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
(leaves) <br>
MCCOY: Scotty doesn't believe in gods. <br>
KIRK: Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though,
once. Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of
space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean. <br>
MCCOY: Yes. To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece,
creatures like that would have been gods. <br>
KIRK: Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and
command great energy. In fact, they couldn't have been taken for
anything else. </font></p>

UHURA: I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this. <br>

UHURA: I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit. <br>
SPOCK: Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle. <br>

from the other four. <br>
SPOCK: And Apollo? <br>
KIRK: I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir. <br>
SULU: Mister Spock, here's something. There seems to be a radiated
energy pulsation coming from the planet. I don't know what it is, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Origin? <br>
SULU: I can't seem to pinpoint it. <br>
SPOCK: I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the
power source is, you should find out where it is not. A simple process
of elimination. <br>

CAROLYN: Oh, it's lovely. <br>
APOLLO: I've known other women. Daphne, Cassandra, but none more
beautiful than you. Are you frightened of me? <br>
CAROLYN: Frightened? No, I don't think so. Of course, a girl doesn't go
walking with a <br>
APOLLO: A god? <br>
CAROLYN: All right, a god every day. What happened to the others?
Artemis, Hera? <br>
APOLLO: They returned to the cosmos on the wings of the wind. <br>
CAROLYN: You mean they died? <br>
APOLLO: No, not as you understand it. We're immortal, we gods. But the
Earth changed. Your fathers changed. They turned away until we were
only memories. A god cannot survive as a memory. We need love,
admiration, worship, as you need food. <br>
CAROLYN: You really think you're a god? <br>
APOLLO: In a real sense, we were gods. We had the power of life and
death. We could have struck out from Olympus and destroyed. We have no
wish to destroy, so we came home again. It was an empty place without
worshippers, but we had no strength to leave, so we waited, all of us,
through the long years. <br>
CAROLYN: But you said the others didn't die. <br>
APOLLO: Even for a god, there's a point of no return. Hera was first.
She stood in front of the temple and spread herself upon the wind,
thinner and thinner, until only the wind remained. But I knew you would
come. You striving, bickering, foolishly brave humans. I knew you would
come to the stars one day. Of all the gods, I knew and I waited, waited
for you to come and sit by my side. <br>
CAROLYN: I don't understand. <br>
APOLLO: Even five thousand years ago, the gods took mortals to them to
love, to care for, like Zeus took Leto, my mother. We were gods of
passion, of love. <br>

SCOTT:
Unquestionably, an immensely powerful field of energy is being
generated around here somewhere. We're just having difficulty focusing
on it. <br>
KIRK: Apollo has no difficulty focusing. He taps that energy, Mister
Scott. <br>
CHEKOV: Sir, some creatures can generate and control energy with no
harm to themselves. The electric eel on Earth, the giant dry worm of
Antos Four, the fluffy <br>
MCCOY: Not the whole encyclopaedia, Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: The captain requires complete information. <br>
MCCOY: Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and
channels it through his body? <br>
CHEKOV: That would seem most likely, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But
where is the source of that power? <br>
MCCOY: Number one on our list of things to do. <br>
KIRK: Is that all you have to offer? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition. In spite
of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a
few variations. However, there's an extra organ in his chest that I
can't even make a guess about. <br>

finger blast of electricity for his effort.) <br>

CHEKOV: He disappeared again like the cat in that Russian story. <br>
KIRK: Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat? <br>
CHEKOV: Cheshire? No, sir. Minsk perhaps, but <br>
KIRK: All right, all right, all right. <br>
CHEKOV: Sir, there is something I noticed. Apollo looked very strange
when he disappeared, tired or in pain. I don't know if it means
anything. <br>
KIRK: Very good, Mister Chekov. That might very well mean something. <br>
MCCOY: How do you feel? <br>
SCOTT: I can't get my arm to move. <br>
MCCOY: Some neural damage. <br>
KIRK: We've got to get out of here. <br>
CHEKOV: How? <br>
KIRK: Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like
our friend Apollo did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of the
Greek classic myths. <br>
MCCOY: Makes sense. <br>
KIRK: Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient
legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we
humans. <br>
CHEKOV: And Apollo's gone, after attacking you and Mister Scott. You
think maybe he's off somewhere recharging his energy cells? <br>
KIRK: Something like that. Remember, he's keeping a force field on the
ship and he's expending energy down here. You said he looked pained and
tired when he disappeared. If we can wear him out, overwork him, that
might do it. <br>
MCCOY: The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed. <br>
KIRK: If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's
a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him. <br>
MCCOY: I still say it can get us killed. <br>
KIRK: Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll
have to take. </font></p>

communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics
lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in
selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint
charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them
in with the combined output of all our engines. <br>
KYLE: Right away, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Apollo reappears on his throne, Carolyn standing
by his side.) <br>
APOLLO: Come here! I know you're trying to escape me. It's useless. I
know everything you do. I tried to be compassionate toward your kind. <br>
KIRK: You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote
ancestors who trembled before your tricks. Your tricks don't frighten
us, neither do you. We've come a long way in five thousand years. <br>
APOLLO: But you're of the same nature. I could sweep you out of
existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again. I can give
life or death. What else does mankind demand of its gods? <br>
KIRK: Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate. <br>
APOLLO: We shall not debate, mortal. I offer you eternal rest and
happiness according to the ancient ways. I ask little in return, but
what I ask for I insist upon. Approach me. (the four men turn their
backs on him) I said approach me! <br>
KIRK: We're busy. (quietly) Look after the girl. <br>
APOLLO: You will gather laurel leaves, light the ancient fires, kill a
deer, make your sacrifices to me. Apollo has spoken! <br>
KIRK: Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking! <br>
ALL: Ha ha ha ha. <br>
MCCOY: Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard. <br>
CAROLYN: Captain. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, get back. <br>
APOLLO: You shall reap the rewards of your insolence! <br>
KIRK: We're tired of your phony fireworks! <br>
APOLLO: Mortal, you have earned this! <br>
CAROLYN: No, don't! <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant! <br>
CAROLYN: A father doesn't destroy his children. You said you were
gentle and understanding. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant! <br>
CAROLYN: How can they worship you if you hurt them? <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. <br>
CAROLYN: Apollo, please. (taking his hand) You know so much of love.
Please don't hurt them. Please. <br>
APOLLO: I shall be lenient with you, for her sake. You will make plans
to bring the rest of your people down. Be sure your artisans bring
tools.
You will need homes. <br>
KIRK: And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play,
and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes. <br>
APOLLO: You will dismantle your ship for the supplies you need, and
I'll crush its empty hull. I have been too patient. I shall be patient
no longer. <br>
(He disappears with Carolyn still holding his hand.) <br>
SCOTT: Captain, we've got to do something! <br>
KIRK: We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved
us. <br>
MCCOY: Any more good ideas, Jim? <br>
KIRK: Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's
loyalty. If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">APOLLO: Fools. I offer them more than they could
know. Not just a world, but all that makes it up. Man thinks he's
progressed. They're wrong.
He's merely forgotten those things which gave life meaning. You'll all
be provided for, cared for, happy. There is an order of things in this
universe. Your species has denied it. I come to restore it. And for
you, because you have the sensitivity to understand, I offer you more
than your wildest dreams have ever imagined. You'll become the mother
of a new race of gods. You'll inspire the universe.
All men will revere you almost as a god yourself. And I shall love you

you. <br>

KIRK: Come over there. Well? <br>
CAROLYN: He wants us to live in peace. He wants to provide for us.
He'll give us everything we ever wanted, and he can do it, too. <br>
KIRK: All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now.
You've got work to do. <br>
CAROLYN: I don't understand. <br>
KIRK: He thrives on love, worship, attention. <br>
CAROLYN: Yes? <br>
KIRK: We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you. <br>
CAROLYN: What? <br>
KIRK: Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him. <br>
CAROLYN: Yes. I love him. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you. <br>
CAROLYN: No, not on me. <br>
KIRK: On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save
ourselves. Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing
less than slavery. We might never get help this far out. Or perhaps the
thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals
to you. <br>
CAROLYN: Oh, but you don't understand. He's kind, and he wants the best
for us. And he's so lonely. What you ask would break his heart. How can
I? <br>
KIRK: Give me your hand. Your hand. (she does) Now feel that. Human
flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history,
the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any
untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't
escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it,
Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and
blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly
yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies. Do you
understand me? <br>
CAROLYN: Yes. Yes, I understand. He's calling me. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty. <br>

our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings. In a

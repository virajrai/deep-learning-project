Captain's log, stardate 5725.3. The Enterprise is en route to Memory
Alpha. It is a planetoid set up by the Federation solely as a central
library containing the total cultural history and scientific knowledge
of all planetary Federation members. With us is specialist Lieutenant
Mira Romaine. She is on board to supervise the transfer of newly
designed equipment directly from the Enterprise to Memory Alpha.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: You're the sanest, the smartest, the nicest
woman that has ever come aboard this ship. <br>
MIRA: Anything else? <br>
SCOTT: Anything else, I'll keep to myself for the moment. <br>
KIRK [OC]: When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness
of his life is suddenly revealed to him. His whole heart once throbbed
only to the ship's engines. He could talk only to the ship. Now he can
see nothing but the woman.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHEKOV: I didn't think Mister Scott would go for
the brainy type. <br>
SULU: I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott. Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: (turning from Mira) Hmm? <br>
KIRK: As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and
Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor. You’ll
prepare for direct transfer of equipment. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. <br>
MIRA: We're ready, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your
first assignment for the Federation? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant. <br>
MIRA: Thank you. <br>
SULU: Captain, I'm picking up a high intensity reading. <br>
KIRK: Is that Memory Alpha? <br>
SULU: No, sir. <br>
(There's a bright thing in the middle of the viewscreen.) An engineer
touches Scott's arm to attract his attention.) <br>
SCOTT: Excuse me. <br>
KIRK: Magnification eight. What is that? <br>
SPOCK: Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one
of such great intensity or strange confirmation. <br>
KIRK: Readings? <br>
SPOCK: All sensor readings are at maximum calibration. <br>
SULU: Captain, it's approaching at warp factor two point six and
accelerating. <br>
KIRK: Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed
of light. <br>
SPOCK: It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a
phenomenon of nature. <br>
KIRK: Deflectors on. Condition yellow. <br>
UHURA: Condition yellow, sir. <br>
SULU: Shields activated, Captain. <br>
(The bright thing 'invades' the ship with sparkles. Only Mira does not
shield her eyes from it. Then the sparkles withdraw.) <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here! Full scan on the
disturbance that penetrated the Bridge. Lieutenant, all decks, damage
report. <br>
(Mira gently falls to the floor.) <br>
SCOTT: Mira! <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency. Emergency. <br>
SCOTT: Mira! Mira! (her eyes and mouth are open) What's that you're
saying'? <br>
(McCoy enters) <br>
MCCOY: Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance? <br>
KIRK: I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed. How's
she doing, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Well, I think she's coming around now. <br>
SCOTT: Easy, now. Easy. You had quite a fall. <br>
MIRA: I'm, I'm fine. <br>
MCCOY: You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to
Sickbay? <br>
MIRA: I'm fine, Doctor. Really, I am. Is everybody else all right? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, they are. Now you just do what Doctor McCoy ordered. <br>
MIRA: Why? I feel <br>
KIRK: Get to Sickbay, Lieutenant. That's an order. <br>
MIRA: Yes, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, would it be all right if I went along to Sickbay? <br>
KIRK: No, Mister Scott. Stay at your post for the moment. <br>
SCOTT: But Captain <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura. Damage report. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. All stations are operative, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were
inoperative. <br>
KIRK: Any damage to the warp engines? <br>
SPOCK: None, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we
can get. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, it was not a storm. <br>
UHURA: Captain. During the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing. I
wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain. It was not hands that were paralysed. It was eyes. I
could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course. <br>
SULU: No, it was speech that was affected. I couldn't utter a sound. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, explanation. <br>
SPOCK: Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different
area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were
under some form of pressure. <br>
KIRK: Or attack. <br>
SPOCK: Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain. <br>
KIRK: And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.

CHAPEL: Everything appears normal, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Thank you. <br>
(Scott enters) <br>
MIRA: What's that you're doing, Nurse? <br>
CHAPEL: Recording your responses in this computer. <br>
MIRA: But why? I haven't had a single response worth noting. <br>
CHAPEL: Lieutenant, please. <br>
MIRA: Well, have l? <br>
MCCOY: Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this
ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why. <br>
MIRA: I want to know why too. You're the doctor, you tell me. This is a
new experience for me. <br>
MCCOY: This whole thing is a new experience for all of us. <br>
MIRA: All of you are accustomed to new experiences. It's part of your
work. I'm not. <br>
SCOTT: She might have something there, Doctor McCoy. This is her first
deep space trip, and you know that affects people. <br>
MCCOY: Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that
determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed
out? <br>
MIRA: Nothing. <br>
MCCOY: Nothing? <br>
MIRA: Absolutely nothing. <br>
MCCOY: Lieutenant <br>
MIRA: Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you. <br>
MCCOY: Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative! <br>
MIRA: Are you putting that into my record? It's not true. <br>
MCCOY: I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them. <br>
SCOTT: Come on now, Mira. We must help the doctor. Tell us what
happened. <br>
MCCOY: Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in
Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation. <br>
SCOTT: I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants. She just didn't
understand. Did you now, lass? <br>
(McCoy leaves) <br>
CHAPEL: With a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong
business. <br>
(Chapel leaves) <br>
MIRA: When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I.
<br>
SCOTT: Oh, you will not! That's ridiculous. This getting used to space
travel, that takes some doing. And not everybody takes to it. <br>
MIRA: Did you? <br>
SCOTT: Well, me, that's different. I was practically born to it. <br>
MIRA: I want to continue. <br>
SCOTT: You will. You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations.
And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs. <br>
MIRA: I hope that's all it is.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SULU: Captain, I've plotted the storm's path. <br>
KIRK: Main screen projection. <br>
SULU: On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it
did us. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that
phenomena. Give me an ETA for its possible impact. <br>
CHEKOV: I cannot, sir. It has the ability to change speed. <br>
UHURA: Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid. I'm
hailing on all frequencies. No response. <br>
SPOCK: It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no
protective shields. <br>
KIRK: No shields? <br>
SPOCK: None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding
was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the
information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special
protection was deemed unnecessary. <br>
KIRK: Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale. <br>
CHEKOV: Completing approach to planetoid. <br>
SULU: It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain! Its speed is
incredible. It's hitting the planetoid. <br>
KIRK: Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: Making final approach. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, try and warn them of <br>
UHURA: I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha? <br>
SPOCK: It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and
scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the
computer complex. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, we are within orbit range. <br>
KIRK: Lock into orbit. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, sir. <br>
SULU: It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: Any life readings? <br>
SPOCK: None. <br>
KIRK: Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering.
Mister Scott, report. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott. Where the
devil is he? Scotty, report to the Bridge. Report to the Bridge. Have
the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, where've you been? Where are you? <br>
SCOTT: In the Sickbay. <br>
KIRK: Are you sick? </font></p>

meet me in the transporter room on the double. <br>

image of a dead alien presumably on Memory Alpha)

storm has cleared Memory Alpha. It is heading away at incredible speed.

darkness unnerving. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, can you get us some more light? <br>
SCOTT: I'm afraid this light'll have to do, Captain. The generator is
inoperative. <br>
KIRK: Damage report, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is
damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be
irretrievable. <br>
SCOTT: Captain! <br>
(They go into the next area and find the body we saw in Mira's eye,
along with others.) <br>
SPOCK: A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about
this enemy. <br>

MCCOY: Over here, Captain! <br>
KIRK: Bones, can you do something? <br>
MCCOY: Not a thing, Jim. (the woman's mouth is moving) The same garbled
sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm. <br>
KIRK: Are you sure? <br>
MCCOY: Absolutely sure. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
SULU [OC]: Sulu here. <br>
KIRK: Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately. <br>
SULU [OC]: Yes, sir. <br>
(The woman's face turns different vivid colours.) <br>
KIRK: Spock, have you seen anything like that before? <br>
SPOCK: Negative. <br>
KIRK: Bones? <br>
MCCOY: She's dead. <br>
KIRK: What did she die of? <br>
MCCOY: Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural
systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality
factors, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: The attack was thorough. <br>
KIRK: What did the others die of? <br>
MCCOY: Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown. <br>
KIRK: A different centre of the brain, you say? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship
and use the ship's computers. <br>
(Mira beams in) <br>
SCOTT: Mira! The captain has some questions.<br>
MIRA: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking. <br>
MIRA: What did I say? <br>
KIRK: I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me. <br>
MIRA: What did it sound like? <br>
KIRK: They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the
technician. <br>
MIRA: What technician? <br>
MCCOY: We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were
dead, and we <br>

KIRK: How do you know? <br>
MIRA: I know. You'll be killed if we stay. <br>

away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims. <br>

Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a
storm. Explain. <br>
SPOCK: No known conditions in space would support that type of natural
phenomenon. <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be
under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants
of Memory Alpha were. <br>
KIRK: Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted. <br>

SPOCK: Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct
life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital. <br>

SPOCK: Impossible to determine without programming for computer
analysis. <br>

SPOCK: I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective
defence. <br>
KIRK: There must be some defence we can use. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their
attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which
is most compatible. <br>
KIRK: Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all
channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's
alive. Maybe I can talk to it. <br>
UHURA: All channels open. Translator tied in. <br>

harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please,
do not come any closer to our ship. <br>

KIRK: Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new
crewman. Don't let us upset you. <br>
MIRA: I trust all of you implicitly. I want to help. <br>
KIRK: This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the
time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our
main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured
you. <br>
MIRA: You mustn't worry about hurting me. <br>
KIRK: Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the
information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has
access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two
may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and
ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed? <br>
MCCOY: Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number
Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief
engineer, Starfleet, retired. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the
attackers? <br>
SPOCK: I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main
computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are
possible. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends? <br>
SULU [on monitor]: Status unchanged. They're still with us and keeping
the same distance. <br>
KIRK: Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor,
do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any
history of psychosomatic illness? <br>
MCCOY: Occasional and teenage routine incidents. <br>
KIRK: Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities? <br>
MCCOY: None. <br>
KIRK: Any pathological or unusual empathic responses? <br>
MCCOY: No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and
pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked. <br>
KIRK: Go ahead, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a
standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting. <br>
KIRK: Go ahead. <br>
MCCOY: The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that
Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors
remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two
hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered. <br>
KIRK: That's impossible! <br>
MCCOY: That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as
fingerprints. <br>
KIRK: Let's see it. <br>
(A jagged graph comes up on the monitor. Spock raises an eyebrow) <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine
showed no abnormal telepathic powers. <br>
MCCOY: That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That
might be a factor. <br>
SPOCK: And you are sure that this is the correct slide? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern
of Lieutenant Mira Romaine. <br>
SPOCK: Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking
obtained from the alien life units. <br>
MCCOY: Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be
no error. <br>
KIRK: Check it, Spock. <br>
(Spock puts his computer disc in, and the two patterns overlap and
match exactly.) <br>
SPOCK: As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the
last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry
patterns, tape D and tape H. <br>
COMPUTER: Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant
Mira Romaine and tape H, brain circuitry patterns
of alien life unit, identical. Identical. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
MCCOY: There has been no error. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds
taking place
between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their
thoughts are becoming hers. </font></p>

SCOTT: Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things
in advance. <br>
KIRK: Why didn't you report it? <br>
SCOTT: You don't report space sickness. That's all I thought it was. <br>
KIRK: What did she see? <br>
SCOTT: The first attack on the ship, the attack on Memory Alpha and the
time we nearly lost her. <br>
KIRK: Those were all acts carried out by our attacker. <br>
SCOTT: And? And? <br>
KIRK: Yes, Scotty? What else? <br>
SCOTT: I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I
was wrong. <br>
KIRK: Was he wrong, Lieutenant? <br>
MIRA: Yes, there was one other time. <br>
KIRK: What did you see? <br>
MIRA: I saw Scotty. <br>
KIRK: Where? <br>
MIRA: I don't know. <br>
KIRK: What was he doing? <br>
MIRA: He was dying. Now I understand what's been happening. I've been
seeing through another mind. I've been flooded with thoughts not my own
that control me. Oh, Scotty, Scotty! I'd rather die than hurt you. I'd
rather die. <br>
SCOTT@ All right, now. What's all this talk of dying? They've called
the turn on us three out of four times. Now, that's a better average
than anybody deserves. It's our turn now. We'll fight them. So let's
not hear anything more about dying. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
SULU [OC]: Sulu, Captain. All evasion tactics carried out as ordered. <br>
KIRK: What success did you have? <br>
SULU [OC]: It’s been useless, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: At their present force, they will get through the shields this
time, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Warp eight, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU [OC]: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they
did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we
have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function
through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you
try? <br>
MIRA: Tell me what to do. <br>
KIRK: Captain Kirk to medical lab. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: Medical lab here, sir. <br>
KIRK: Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go. </font></p>

(The pretty lights enter the room) <br>
MIRA: Don't touch me, Scotty! Stay away. <br>
(Then enter Mira. She changes colour and makes the strange noise) <br>
SCOTT: We've lost her to them. <br>
KIRK: Stay where you are. <br>
MCCOY: She could kill us all in this state. <br>
SPOCK: She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has
planned. <br>
SCOTT: Stay with us, Mira. Please stay. <br>
MIRA: I'm trying. I want to be with you. They are too strong. <br>
KIRK: Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on. <br>
MIRA: I am Mira Romaine. I will be who I choose to be. I will. Stay
away, Scotty! They are with me. They will kill you. <br>
SCOTT: You won't let them. <br>
ZETAR: (through Mira) She cannot stop us. You cannot prevent it. <br>
SCOTT: Mira. Mira! Captain. <br>
KIRK: That's not Mira talking. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still
retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using
her voice. <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you
understand? <br>
ZETAR: Yes, we understand you. We have searched for a millennium for
one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives. <br>
KIRK: Who are you? <br>
ZETAR: We are from Zetar. <br>
SPOCK: That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was
destroyed. <br>
KIRK: You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago. <br>
ZETAR: Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed. <br>
KIRK: Then what are you? <br>
ZETAR: The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last
hundred of Zetar. The force of our life could not be wiped out. <br>
KIRK: All things die. <br>
ZETAR: At the proper time. Our planet was dying. We were determined to
live on. At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck
us down. But the force of our lives survived. At last we have found
someone through whom we can live it out. <br>
KIRK: The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead. <br>
ZETAR: She will accept ours. <br>
KIRK: She will not. She is fighting for her own identity. <br>
ZETAR: Her mind will accept our thoughts. Our lives will be fulfilled. <br>
KIRK: Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned? <br>
ZETAR: We did not wish to kill. <br>
KIRK: But you did kill! <br>
ZETAR: No. Resisting us killed those people. We did not kill them. <br>
KIRK: The price of your survival is too high. <br>
ZETAR: We only want the girl. <br>
KIRK: You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not
another's. <br>
MIRA: Life was given to me. It is mine. I want to live it out. I will <br>
MCCOY: The girl’s life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians.
She's losing. <br>
ZETAR: Do not fight us. <br>
SPOCK: They will not accept their own deaths. <br>
KIRK: They'll be forced to accept it. <br>
ZETAR: You will all die. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out
their threat. <br>
KIRK: We must get her into the pressure chamber. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might
kill the girl too. <br>
SCOTT: Mira will not kill me. <br>
(Scott picks her up and gets her into the chamber before being thrown
across the room) <br>
SCOTT: I told you she wouldn't kill me. <br>
KIRK: Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity. <br>
MCCOY: The Zetars are growing stronger. <br>
SPOCK: The weightless state has become their natural condition. <br>
KIRK: Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then
increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure.
Pressure, Spock. Pressure. <br>
MCCOY: The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her. <br>
KIRK: Continue, Spock. <br>
(The lights leave Mira) <br>
KIRK: Pressure! <br>
(The lights fizzle away) <br>
MCCOY: We've done it, Jim. They're gone. <br>
SCOTT: (intercom) It's all right, Mira. They're gone. They're gone! <br>
(She looks at him and smiles) <br>
MCCOY: Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take
deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply.
In, out. In, out. That's it. Now, you'll be in there another twenty
minutes, so why don't you just try to relax? <br>
SCOTT: Now we have all the time in the world. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Bones, are you able to judge the long range
effects on Lieutenant Romaine? <br>
MCCOY: When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions
are hazardous. <br>
SPOCK: Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the
Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I
find that encouraging. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult
to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her
struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure. <br>
KIRK: Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a
factor? <br>
SPOCK: You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for
that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However <br>
MCCOY: There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor,
and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery. <br>
KIRK: Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not
return to Starbase for further treatment? <br>
MCCOY: Well, I should think work would be a better therapy. <br>
SPOCK: Logical. <br>

SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine? <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Beautiful, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?
<br>
SCOTT [OC]: Positively, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Kirk to Bridge. <br>
SULU [OC]: Sulu, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has
a lot of work to do there. <br>
SULU [OC]: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and
Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement. Can I stand the
strain? </font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A landing party of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Yeoman
Thompson and a security guard have just beamed down.) <br>
SPOCK: No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan. <br>
MCCOY: Well, somebody sent a distress call. <br>
KIRK: No sign of the spaceship. No sign of debris. <br>
SPOCK: I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is
possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded
here in a shuttle craft. <br>
KIRK: But where are they? <br>
THOMPSON: Captain, I'm getting a reading now. Two human forms at
bearing three hundred mark seven. <br>
SPOCK: Confirmed. <br>
(A male in an orange suit and a female in a blue outfit approach the
party.) <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain James T. Kirk, of the starship Enterprise. We came in
answer to your distress call. <br>
ROJAN: It was very kind of you to respond so quickly, captain. Now you
will surrender your ship to me. <br>
KIRK: You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister <br>
(The man presses a button on his belt, and Kirk, Spock and McCoy are
immobilised. The woman does the same to the Yeoman and guard.) <br>
ROJAN: I am Rojan of Kelva. I am your commander from this moment on.
Any efforts to resist us or to escape will be severely punished. Soon
we, and you, will leave this galaxy forever. You humans must face the
end of your existence as you have known it. You are all paralyzed by a
selective field that neutralises nerve impulses to the voluntary
muscles. We can control you at will. I will now release you. <br>
KIRK: Stay there. <br>
THOMPSON: Captain. <br>
KIRK: It's all right. <br>
SPOCK: Interesting. A neural field? <br>
ROJAN: Yes. Radiating from a central projector. <br>
KIRK: What do you want? <br>
ROJAN: Your ship, Captain Kirk. It will serve us well in the long
voyage that is to come. <br>
KIRK: Voyage? Where? <br>
ROJAN: To your neighbouring galaxy, which you call Andromeda. <br>
KIRK: Andromeda? Why? <br>
ROJAN: It is our home. <br>
SPOCK: What brings you here? <br>
ROJAN: Within ten millennia, high radiation levels in our galaxy will
make life there impossible. So the Kelvan Empire sent forth ships to
explore other galaxies, to search for one which our race could conquer
and occupy. <br>
KIRK: Well, sorry. This galaxy is already occupied. <br>
ROJAN: Captain, you think you are unconquerable and your ship
impregnable, but while we've talked, the capture has already begun. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROJAN: Report, Hanar. <br>
HANAR [OC]: The ship is ours. We control the bridge, engineering, and
life support systems. <br>
ROJAN: Proceed with your orders. <br>
KIRK: What's the point of capturing my ship? Even at maximum warp, the
Enterprise couldn't get to Andromeda galaxy for thousands of years. <br>
ROJAN: Captain, we will modify its engines, in order to produce
velocities far beyond the reach of your science. The journey between
galaxies will take less than three hundred of your years. <br>
Spock Fascinating. Intergalactic travel requiring only three hundred
years. That is a leap far beyond anything man has yet accomplished. <br>
THOMPSON: You made a voyage of three hundred years? <br>
KELINDA: Our ships were of multigeneration design. We were born in the
intergalactic void. We shall die there during our return journey. <br>
ROJAN: And our mission will be completed by a commander who is my
descendant. <br>
KIRK: What happened to your ship? <br>
ROJAN: There is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I know. We've been there. <br>
ROJAN: We managed to break through it with great difficulty. Our ship
was destroyed. We barely managed to escape in a lifecraft. And now we
have the means to begin our journey back to Andromeda. <br>
SPOCK: Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy? <br>
ROJAN: No form of transmission can penetrate the barrier. <br>
KIRK: Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your
problem to the Federation. Research expeditions have catalogued
hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for
colonization. <br>
ROJAN: We do not colonize. We conquer. We rule. There's no other way
for us. <br>
MCCOY: In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us. <br>
KIRK: The Federation has handled foreign invasions before. <br>
ROJAN: Captain, we can control the Federation as easily as we can
control you. The fate of the inferior in any galaxy. <br>
(Hanar suddenly appears on the planet.) <br>
HANAR: All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan. <br>
ROJAN: Kelinda, take them to the holding area. We'll keep you and your
party here, Captain. Your crew will undoubtedly wish to co-operate with
us if they understand that you are hostages. <br>
KELINDA: Move there. <br>
HANAR: Tomar has examined the ship. The modifications are underway. <br>
ROJAN: Space again, Hanar. I do not think we could have kept our sanity
living too long on this accursed planet. <br>
HANAR: It is an undisciplined environment. One cannot control it. Yet
there are things of interest. <br>
ROJAN: Yes, but disturbing. These shells in which we've encased
ourselves, they have such heightened senses. To feel. To hear. To
smell. How do humans manage to exist in these fragile cases? <br>
HANAR: Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have
little choice. <br>
ROJAN: At least we'll be away from all of this openness. This is too
strange for us, Hanar. We are creatures of outer space, and soon we
will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rock walls with metal bars across the 'door'.) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably
more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular
structure. <br>
KIRK: All right. We can't break out. There must be another way. <br>
THOMPSON: Captain, what do they want from us. What kind of people are
they? <br>
KIRK: That's a very good question. <br>
MCCOY: They registered as human. <br>
SPOCK: No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human
life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook
responses. Most curious. <br>
KIRK: Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life
forms in another galaxy? <br>
SPOCK: The chances are very much against it. <br>
GUARD: Captain. (Kalinda has appeared so they move away from the door)
Captain. However perfect they are, there don't seem to be very many of
them. Why... <br>
KIRK: They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a
central projector. <br>
MCCOY: Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a
chance. <br>
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what
this projector looks like. <br>
KIRK: Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the
force field. <br>
SPOCK: Possible. I would have to have one to examine. <br>
GUARD: You'll have one, sir, if I have to rip one of the Kelvans apart
to get it for you. <br>
KIRK: You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders. <br>
GUARD: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan
mind probe. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped. <br>
KIRK: Do you think you can do it again? <br>
SPOCK: I shall attempt it. <br>
(Kelinda seems to be getting nervous as Spock makes his attempt, then
he is suddenly thrown across the cell. They go to his aid, Kelinda
enters and Kirk grabs her and knocks her out. He takes the belt
device.) <br>
KIRK: Are you all right? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(But as they come running out of their cell, Rojan
and Hanar immobilise them. Kelinda walks over and is given her device
back.) <br>
ROJAN: (releasing Kirk) This cannot go unpunished. Hanar. That one.
(the guard) Take him aside. Kelinda, the female. <br>
THOMPSON: Captain? <br>
ROJAN: Go. As a leader, you realize the importance of discipline. I
need you and these other specialists, but those two are unnecessary. <br>
KIRK: I'm responsible. Let them go. <br>
ROJAN: I think we're somewhat alike, Captain. Each of us cares less for
his own safety than for the lives of his command. We feel pain when
others suffer for our mistakes. Your punishment shall be to watch them
die. Captain. Proceed, Hanar. <br>
(The guard and the yeoman are reduced to blocks of solid matter.) <br>
ROJAN: Bring them to me. This is the essence of what they were. The
flesh and brain and what you call the personality, distilled down into
these compact shapes. And once crushed (he demonstrates) this person is
dead. However, that one can be restored. (throws it on the ground)
Hanar? <br>
(The security guard reappears.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Spock, are you sure you're all right? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, quite all right, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch. <br>
SPOCK: I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've
never experienced before. <br>
KIRK: What was it? <br>
SPOCK: A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and
consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and
blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been
able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which
resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb
is capable of performing a different function. <br>
MCCOY: Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are? <br>
SPOCK: Undoubtedly. <br>
MCCOY: Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt
themselves to our bodies? <br>
KIRK: Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best
vessel for the trip. Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have
difficulty with the turbolift. We've got to stop them. We outnumber
them. Their only hold on us is the paralysis field. <br>
MCCOY: Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural
circuits. <br>
KIRK: Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's
neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis
projector? <br>
SPOCK: I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The
medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The
polarized elements would burn out quickly. <br>
KIRK: Is there a chance at all? <br>
SPOCK: A small one. <br>
KIRK: We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship. <br>
MCCOY: How? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick. <br>
SPOCK: I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health. <br>
KIRK: No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough
examination, and you're ill. In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay,
you're going to die. <br>
MCCOY: It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's
healthy. <br>
KIRK: Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance,
complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body. <br>
SPOCK: We find it more restful to the body than your so-called
vacation. <br>
KIRK: Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half
an hour? <br>
SPOCK: It will take me a moment to prepare. <br>
KIRK: Go ahead. <br>
(Spock touches his forehead, straightens up, then falls gently into
McCoy and Kirk's arms.) <br>
MCCOY: Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically
non-existent.&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: (goes to the door) Hanar? Hanar. <br>
HANAR: What do you want, human? <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying. <br>
HANAR: This illness came on him rather suddenly. Is it not unusual? <br>
KIRK: He's a Vulcan. They don't react like humans.&nbsp;<br>
MCCOY: He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance
he'll live. <br>
HANAR: Stand away from the door. (enters the cell for a closer look) I
will have you beamed aboard. <br>
KIRK: Do what you can with him, Bones. </font></p>

CHAPEL: Doctor, what happened? <br>
MCCOY: Prepare two ccs of stokaline. <br>
CHAPEL: Stokaline? But, doctor, that's <br>
MCCOY: Don't argue, nurse. Just get it. (injects Spock) This may be the
turning point. Prepare another shot. <br>
CHAPEL: But, Doctor <br>
MCCOY: Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you? <br>
(Spock opens his eyes then shuts them again before she returns with the
hypo. McCoy gives another injection as Tomar watches from a little
distance.) <br>
MCCOY: There, that should do it. Just let him rest now. (to Tomar) You
see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it
about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no
danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of
hours. <br>

ROJAN: We will beam aboard the vessel shortly. I wish you to understand
your duties. <br>
KIRK: My duty is to stop you in any way I can. <br>
ROJAN: You will obey. <br>
KIRK: Or you will kill more of my people? <br>
ROJAN: Captain Kirk, I cannot believe that you do not understand the
importance of my mission. We Kelvans have a code of honour. Harsh,
demanding. It calls for much from us and much from those whom we
conquer. You have been conquered. I respect your devotion to your duty,
but I cannot permit it to interfere with mine. <br>
KELINDA: (picking a flower and smelling it) These are lovely. Captain
Kirk, what is it you call them? <br>
KIRK: Flowers. I don't know the variety. <br>
KELINDA: Our memory tapes tell us of such things on Kelvan. Crystals
that form with such rapidity, they seem to grow. They look like this
fragile thing somewhat. We call them Sahsheer.&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: A rose by any other name. <br>
KELINDA: Captain? <br>
KIRK: A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare. That which we call
a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.

SCOTT: This is it. Now all we have to do <br>
SPOCK: Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible. <br>
SCOTT: Why? <br>
SPOCK: This material surrounding the projector is the same as I
discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of
our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine. <br>
SCOTT: That's it, then. <br>
SPOCK: There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final
decision, of course, must be the captain's, but
I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by
matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative
energy. <br>

SCOTT: I have opened the control valves to the matter-anti-matter
nacelles. On your signal, I will flood them with positive energy. <br>

KIRK: What neutralising operation? <br>
ROJAN: You humans are troublesome for us. We needed you to get us
through the barrier. But there aren't enough of us to efficiently guard
all of you of the time. Further, the food synthesisers cannot
manufacture enough food for the entire journey. We are therefore
neutralising all nonessential personnel. <br>

much less painful. </font></p>

paralysis projector? I know the casing looks impenetrable, but I may be
able to do something. <br>

projector to bring our people back to human form. <br>

TOMAR: It's quite good. <br>
MCCOY: I'm delighted. <br>
SPOCK: Most curious. <br>
KIRK: What is? <br>
SPOCK: The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's
mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have
superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently
sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive
senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions. <br>
KIRK: But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and
are therefore having human reaction. <br>
MCCOY: If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet. <br>
KIRK: If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we
can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet.
If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from their
belts. <br>
SPOCK: That seems reasonable. <br>
KIRK: All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to
stimulate the senses. <br>
SCOTT: I can think of one way right off. (goes over to Tomar) Lad,
you're going to need something to wash that down with. Have you ever
tried any Saurian brandy? </font></p>

MCCOY: I don't know about that. <br>
HANAR: Please articulate. <br>
MCCOY: Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking
food in pills instead of solid sustenance. <br>
HANAR: What are you doing? <br>
MCCOY: I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate.
You'll need three a day for a few days. And eat some solid food, will
you? </font></p>

KIRK: Am I disturbing you? <br>
KELINDA: What is it you wish? <br>
KIRK: I wish to apologise. <br>
KELINDA: I don't understand, Captain. <br>
KIRK: For hitting you. I'm sorry. <br>
KELINDA: That is not necessary. You attempted to escape as we would
have. <br>
KIRK: Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women. <br>
KELINDA: Why not? <br>
KIRK: Well, there are better things for men and women to do. <br>
KELINDA: Like what? <br>
(He strokes her collar bone.)<br>
KIRK: Is this where I hit you? <br>
KELINDA: No, the other side. <br>
KIRK: Oh. I'm sorry. (he kisses it) Is that better? <br>
KELINDA: Better? Was it intended as a remedy? <br>
KIRK: This is. <br>
(And gives her a full-on kiss with embrace.) <br>
KELINDA: Is there some significance to this action? <br>
KIRK: Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love. <br>
KELINDA: Oh. You are trying to seduce me. I have been studying you. <br>
KIRK: Me? <br>
KELINDA: All humans. This business of love. You have devoted much
literature to it. Why do you build such a mystique around a simple
biological function? <br>
KIRK: We enjoy it. <br>
KELINDA: The literature? <br>
KIRK: Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject. <br>
KELINDA: Do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable?
<br>
KIRK: I did. <br>
KELINDA: Curious. Let me try. <br>
(She kisses him, and Rojan enters.) <br>
ROJAN: Is there some problem, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Not when I came in. <br>
(Kirk leaves) <br>
ROJAN: What did he want here? <br>
KELINDA: He came to apologise for hitting me. Apparently it involves
some peculiar touching contact. <br>
ROJAN: In what manner? (she kisses him) Very odd creatures, these
humans. </font></p>

SPOCK: Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable,
but an interesting psychological study.&nbsp;<br>
ROJAN: Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the
lips to apologise. <br>
SPOCK: I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding
that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some
affection for each other. <br>
ROJAN: Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk. <br>
SPOCK: Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident? <br>
ROJAN: Why should I be disturbed? <br>
SPOCK: You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are.
Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually
indicate jealousy. <br>
ROJAN: I have no reason for such a reaction. Kelinda's a female,
nothing more. <br>
SPOCK: Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive. <br>
ROJAN: Well, of course she is! <br>
SPOCK: You are not jealous? <br>
ROJAN: No! <br>

KELINDA: Yes? <br>
ROJAN: I do not wish you to fraternise with any of the humans. <br>
KELINDA: Why not? <br>
ROJAN: Well, they, they offer such strange ideas. They're not meant for
us. Not for Kelvans. <br>
KELINDA: Have you given this order to the others? <br>
ROJAN: No. And I wish you to particularly avoid Captain Kirk. <br>
KELINDA: I will not. You have told me over and over again, humans are
no threat to us. We are superior. I will do as I please. <br>
ROJAN: You will do as I say, or I will neutralise your Captain Kirk and
all the other humans as well. <br>

MCCOY: Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better
stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding. <br>

anywhere. And I haven't seen Scotty in hours. <br>
MCCOY: We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more
irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should
have him climbing the walls. <br>
SPOCK: Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy. <br>

KELINDA: I would like to speak with you, Captain. <br>

HANAR: First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been
portioned out to us. <br>
ROJAN: It's the way your duties have always been assigned. <br>
HANAR: That is my second quarrel with you. <br>
ROJAN: Hanar! <br>
HANAR: And further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship. <br>

monitoring and periodic adjustments. <br>
ROJAN: Very well. Proceed. Have you seen Captain Kirk? <br>
SPOCK: If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge. <br>
ROJAN: No. I was wondering where he was. <br>
SPOCK: I left him in the recreation room. <br>
ROJAN: He was alone then. <br>
SPOCK: No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him. <br>

KIRK: If you can't keep her, that's not my problem. <br>
ROJAN: You will release her! <br>
(Rojan drags Kirk away from Kalinda. Kirk slaps him across the face,
twice. Finally he has goaded him into a fight.) <br>
KIRK: Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your
woman away from you. You're jealous! You tried to kill me with your
bare hands. Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting
with the emotions of a human. You are a human. <br>
ROJAN: No, I cannot be! <br>
(He throws off Kirk, into the arms of Spock and McCoy who are entering
the room.) <br>
KIRK: I'm stimulating him. (McCoy pushes him back into the fight.) You
have no choice. To use this ship, you have to use our form and now
you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three
hundred years. <br>
ROJAN: You fool. These bodies are tools. We remain Kelvans! <br>
KIRK: Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us.
What do you think will happen in three centuries? When this ship gets
to Kelva, the people on it will be human. They'll be aliens. Enemies! <br>
ROJAN: We have a duty, our mission. We've got to accomplish any way we
can. <br>
KIRK: Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in.
You can still do that. We can bring this problem to the Federation.
There are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited. <br>
ROJAN: You would really do that? You would extend welcome to invaders? <br>
(They finally stop fighting.) <br>
KIRK: No. But we would welcome friends. <br>
SPOCK: Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given
three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a
destiny of your own. <br>
ROJAN: Perhaps. Perhaps it could be done. <br>
SPOCK: A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation
proposal. <br>
ROJAN: But if we retain this form, where could we find a place? <br>
MCCOY: Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice. <br>
ROJAN: And you. You would wish to remain with him? <br>
KELINDA: He's most interesting, but I wish to go with you. I believe I
owe you an apology. (she kisses Rojan) It's most pleasurable. <br>
ROJAN: Yes. Very curious. <br>
KIRK: You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being
able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman. <br>
ROJAN: Bridge, this is Rojan. <br>
DREA [OC]: Yes, Commander. <br>
ROJAN: I'm returning command of the ship to Captain Kirk. You will
follow his orders. <br>

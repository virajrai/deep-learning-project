Captain's Log, Stardate 2947.3. We have been through a severe ion
storm. One crewman is dead. Ship's damage is considerable. I have
ordered a non-scheduled layover on Starbase Eleven for repairs. A full
report of damages was made to the commanding officer of Starbase
Eleven, Commodore Stone.

STONE: Maintenance Section Eighteen. The section is working on the

three times you've read it, Jim. Is there an error? <br>

STONE: It's a great pity. The service can't afford to lose men like
Lieutenant Commander Finney. <br>
KIRK: I agree. I waited until the last possible moment. We were on Red
Alert. The storm got worse. I had to jettison the pod. <br>

JAMIE: There you are. I just wanted one more look at you. The man who
killed my father. <br>
KIRK: That's not so. He was my friend. <br>

him, you murderer! You murderer! You murderer! <br>

STONE: Captain Kirk, you say you jettisoned the pod after the Red
Alert? <br>
KIRK: You have my sworn deposition.&nbsp;<br>
STONE: Then, Captain, I must presume you've committed willful perjury.
This extract from your computer log says you jettisoned the pod before
going to Red Alert. Consider yourself confined to the base. Official
inquiry will determine whether a general court martial is in order.

ours. <br>

Excuse me, Bones. <br>

you?&nbsp;<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COMPUTER: Recording inquiry. Matter. Captain Kirk,
James T. Subject. Circumstances of death, Lieutenant Commander Finney,
Benjamin. <br>
STONE: This inquiry, to determine whether a general court-martial
should be convened against Captain Kirk on charges of perjury and
culpable negligence. <br>
KIRK: Ready. <br>
STONE: Let us begin with your relationship with Commander Finney. You
knew him for a long time, didn't you?&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: Yes. He was an instructor at the Academy when I was a midshipman,
but that didn't stand in the way of our beginning a close friendship.
His daughter Jamie, who was here last night, was named after me. <br>
STONE: It's common knowledge that something happened to your
friendship. <br>
KIRK: It's no secret. We were assigned to the same ship some years
later. I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the
atomic matter piles that should've been closed. Another five minutes,
it could have blown up the ship. <br>
COMPUTER: Ship nomenclature. Specify. <br>
KIRK: United Starship Republic, number 1371. <br>
STONE: Continue.&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: I closed the switch and logged the incident. He drew a reprimand
and was sent to the bottom of the promotion list. <br>
STONE: And he blamed you for that? <br>
KIRK: Yes. He had been at the Academy for an unusually long time as an
instructor. As a result, he was late
in being assigned to a starship. The delay, he felt, looked bad on his
record. My action, he believed, made things worse. <br>
STONE: Comment. Service record of Lieutenant Commander Finney to be
appended this inquiry. <br>
COMPUTER: Noted. <br>
STONE: Now let's get into the specifics of the storm, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead. I sent Finney
into the pod.&nbsp;<br>
STONE: Why Finney? <br>
KIRK: His name was at the top of the duty roster. <br>
STONE: If he blamed you <br>
KIRK: He may have blamed me that he never rose to command a ship, but I
don't assign jobs on the basis of who blames me. It was Finney's turn,
and I assigned him. He had just checked in with me from the pod when we
hit the leading edge of the storm. Not too bad at first. I signalled a
Yellow Alert. Then we began encountering pressure, variant stress,
force seven, the works. I finally signaled a Red Alert. Finney knew he
had a matter of seconds. I gave him those seconds and more. But
apparently it wasn't enough. <br>
STONE: Then why, Captain, does the computer log from your ship, made
automatically at the time, indicate that you were still on Yellow Alert
when you jettisoned and not on Red? <br>
KIRK: I don't know. There's been a mistake. <br>
STONE: It would seem so. Could the computer be wrong? <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next
to impossible. <br>
STONE: Stop recording. Now, look, Jim. Not one man in a million could
do what you and I have done. Command a starship.
A hundred decisions a day, hundreds of lives staked on you making every
one of them right. You're played out, Jim. Exhausted. <br>
KIRK: Is that the way you see it? <br>
STONE: That's the way my report'll read if you co-operate. <br>
KIRK: A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse. <br>
STONE: Possibly. <br>
KIRK: I'd be admitting a man died because <br>
STONE: Admit nothing. Say nothing. Let me bury the matter here and now.
No starship captain has ever stood trial before, and I don't want you
to be the first.
KIRK: But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty. I should be
punished. <br>
STONE: I'm thinking of the service. I won't have it smeared. <br>
KIRK: By what, Commodore Stone? <br>
STONE: All right. By an evident perjurer who's either covering his bad
judgment, his cowardice, or <br>
KIRK: That's as far as you go, sir. I'm telling you I was there on the
Bridge. I know what happened. I know what I did. <br>
STONE: It's in the transcript, and computer transcripts don't lie. I'm
telling you, Captain, either you accept a permanent ground assignment,
or the whole disciplinary weight of Starfleet command is going to light
right on your neck. <br>
KIRK: So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me
along with it? Not on your life. I intend to fight. <br>
STONE: Then you draw a general court. <br>
KIRK: Draw it? I demand it. And right now, Commodore Stone. Right now.

do it, they'll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the

SPOCK: Affirmative. <br>
SHAW: Do you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in

computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial, is it not? <br>

extreme emergency that did not then exist. <br>

especially space psychology. Patterns which develop in the close
quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep space. <br>
MCCOY: I know something about it. <br>
SHAW: You have just heard the testimony of your own personnel officer,
that it was an action of the then Ensign Kirk, which placed an
unerasable blot on the record of the then Lieutenant Finney.
Psychologically, Doctor, is it possible that Lieutenant Finney blamed
Kirk for the incident? <br>
MCCOY: It's possible. <br>
SHAW: He could have hated Kirk down through the years, blamed him for
being passed over for promotion, blamed him for never being given a
command of his own, correct? <br>
MCCOY: He could have. <br>
SHAW: Now, let us hypothesise, Doctor. Is it normal for a person to
return affection for hatred? <br>
MCCOY: No. <br>
SHAW: Do we not tend to at first resent and then actively dislike the
person who hates us? <br>
MCCOY: Wait a minute. I don't quite follow you. <br>
SHAW: Hypothetically. Would not Captain Smith begin to hate Lieutenant
Commander Jones once he learned that Lieutenant Commander Jones hated
and detested him? <br>
MCCOY: Well, yes, I suppose it could happen. <br>
SHAW: Then I ask you, is it not possible that Captain Kirk became aware
of Lieutenant Commander Finney's hatred toward him
and perhaps, even involuntarily, began to reciprocate? <br>
MCCOY: Not Captain Kirk. <br>
SHAW: Any normal human, Doctor. Is it possible? <br>

indeed a Red Alert before you jettisoned the pod? <br>
KIRK: Yes, sir, there was.&nbsp;<br>
COGLEY: Please tell us about it. <br>
KIRK: Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from
the computer log. We were in an ion storm. Everyone here in this court
knows the dangers involved. I was in command. The decisions were mine,
no one else's. Charges of malice have been raised. There was no malice.
Lieutenant Commander Finney was a member of my crew, and that's exactly
the way he was treated. It has been suggested that I panicked on the
bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely. That is not so. You've
heard some of the details of my record. This was not my first crisis.
It was one of many. During it, I did what my experience and training
required me to do. I took the proper steps in the proper order. I did
exactly what had to be done, exactly when it should have been done. <br>
COGLEY: You did the right thing, but would you do it again? <br>
KIRK: Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without
hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were
absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship. And nothing is more
important than my ship. <br>
COGLEY: Your witness, Miss Shaw. <br>
SHAW: The prosecution does not wish to dishonour this man, but facts
are facts. I must invite the attention of the court and Captain Kirk to
this visual extract from the Enterprise computer log. Play back. What
you are about to see is precisely what took place on the Enterprise
bridge during the ion storm.

accept that, however. <br>

I'd like to ask the court to <br>
SHAW: Objection! Counsel for the defence has rested his case. <br>
STONE: Of what nature is this evidence? <br>
COGLEY: I can't tell you, I'll have to show you. <br>
SHAW: Mister Cogley is well-known for his theatrics. <br>
COGLEY: Is saving an innocent man's career a theatric? i<br>
STONE: Counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the bench. <br>
COGLEY: I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've got something human to
talk about. Rights, sir, human rights. The Bible, the Code of Hammurabi
and of Justinian, Magna Carta, the Constitution of the United States,
Fundamental Declarations of the Martian colonies, the Statutes of Alpha
Three. Gentlemen, these documents all speak of rights. Rights of the
accused to a trial by his peers, to be represented by counsel, the
rights of cross-examination, but most importantly, the right to be
confronted by the witnesses against him, a right to which my client has
been denied. <br>
SHAW: Your Honour, that is ridiculous. We produced the witnesses in
court. My learned opponent had the opportunity to see them,
cross-examine them. <br>
COGLEY: All but one. The most devastating witness against my client is
not a human being. It's a machine, an information system. The computer
log of the Enterprise. Can ask this court adjourn and reconvene aboard
that vessel. <br>
SHAW: I protest, Your Honour. <br>
COGLEY: And I repeat, I speak of rights. A machine has none. A man
must. My client has the right to face his accuser, and if you do not
grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the
machine. Indeed, you have elevated that machine above us. I ask that my
motion be granted, and more than that, gentlemen. In the name of
humanity, fading in the shadow of the machine, I demand it. I demand
it!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COGLEY: How many games of chess did you win from
the computer, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Five in all. <br>
COGLEY: May that be considered unusual? <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative. <br>
COGLEY: Why? <br>
SPOCK: I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I
gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The
computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the
best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after
stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either
accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore
the memory banks of that computer. <br>
COGLEY: Could that have had an effect on the visual playback we saw? <br>
SHAW: Object! The witness would be making a conclusion. <br>
STONE: Sustained. <br>
COGLEY: Hypothetically, Mister Spock. Hypothetically, Miss Shaw. If
what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond the capabilities of
most men. Is that true? <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative. <br>
COGLEY: What man aboard ship would it not be beyond? <br>
SPOCK: The Captain, myself, and the records officer. <br>
COGLEY: And at the moment, you have no records officer. <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was
Lieutenant Commander Finney. <br>
COGLEY: Captain Kirk, will you tell the steps you took to find Mister
Finney after the storm? <br>
KIRK: I instituted a phase one search. <br>
COGLEY: Describe a phase one search. <br>
KIRK: It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to
find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond. <br>
COGLEY: It presupposes, does it not, that a man wishes to be found? <br>
KIRK: I beg your pardon? <br>
COGLEY: If you start a search for a man, you assume, don't you, that he
wants to be found? He's not hiding? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
COGLEY: On a ship of this size, could a man evade such a search? <br>
KIRK: Possibly. <br>

is not dead. </font></p>

the extraordinary statement you made in the briefing room. <br>
COGLEY: You shall have it, but first I need the co-operation of this
court in conducting an experiment. Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be
necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the
command crew, to leave the ship. I am ordering all others to report to
the transporter room. <br>
COGLEY: Including myself, sir. <br>
STONE: This court is by no means adjourned, Mister Cogley. <br>

this court, and I will return. <br>

KIRK: Our impulse engines have been shut down. We'll maintain orbit by
momentum. <br>
KRASNOVSKY: And when the orbit decays? <br>
KIRK: We hope to be finished long before that. <br>
(A little later) <br>
KIRK: Ready, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in
effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster, we can increase that
capability on the order of one to the fourth power. The computer should
bring us every sound occurring on the ship. <br>
CREWMAN [OC]: All personnel have left the ship as ordered, sir. <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy? All right, Mister Spock. <br>
(A cacophony of heartbeats comes over the bridge speakers.) <br>
KIRK: Turn it down a little. Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the
heartbeats of all the people on board the ship. Doctor McCoy will use
this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it
will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing. <br>
MCCOY: First, the Captain. Mister Spock. <br>
(He goes around the assembled group one at a time) <br>
MCCOY: And lastly, myself. <br>
KIRK: That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room.
Mister Spock, eliminate his heartbeat. That accounts for everyone. <br>

KIRK: Seal off B deck, sections 18Y through 23D. <br>

towards a blue one.) <br>
SPOCK: Passing outer planet, Zeon. <br>
KIRK: We want the inner one, Ekos. Plot a standard orbit, Mister
Chekov, and take us in. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, raise John Gill on Starfleet communications. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
MCCOY: Starfleet's been trying for six months. If he's alive, isn't it
unlikely that he'd receive us now? <br>
KIRK: I don't know, Bones. We're here to find out what's happened
because I don't know. <br>
SPOCK: I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text
he prepared. <br>
KIRK: I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy. <br>
SPOCK: What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as
causes and motivations rather than dates and events. <br>
UHURA: Captain, no response on any Starfleet channel. <br>
CHEKOV: Spacecraft approaching from inner planet. <br>
KIRK: From Ekos? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude
interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on
an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection
devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have. <br>
KIRK: Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant? <br>
UHURA: Nothing, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a
warhead. <br>
KIRK: Stand by phasers. <br>
CHEKOV: Phasers ready. <br>
KIRK: Range, Mister Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: Two thousand kilometres, closing fast. <br>
KIRK: Fire. <br>
(A big ball of fire fills the viewscreen. Fire in a vacuum? Never
mind.) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead. <br>
MCCOY: That's generations ahead of where these people should be
technically. How'd they manage that? <br>
KIRK: Maybe they had help. Maximum orbit. Take us out of range of their
detection range. <br>
SPOCK: Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile
from a planet which should have no such weapon. <br>
CHEKOV: Orbit computed and locked in, sir. <br>
KIRK: Execute. <br>
UHURA: Captain, no response from John Gill on any channel. <br>
MCCOY: He must be dead. And what's going on down there on Ekos? <br>
SPOCK: According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike
people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively
high technology, and its people are peaceful. <br>
KIRK: We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance
of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution.
Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our
communicators.

twentieth century manual worker style including woolly hat to cover
Spock's ears.) <br>
KIRK: Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range
in three hours. If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take
our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what
our condition may be. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. Whatever your condition. <br>
KIRK: You ready? <br>
SPOCK: Ready, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Energise.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's very quiet, no people or transport.) <br>
SPOCK: The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in
architecture. Interesting. <br>
(A man runs round the corner and trips.) <br>
ISAK: Hide! They're right behind me. Hide! Hide! <br>
(They do, as three jack-booted soldiers surround the fallen man and
kick him.) <br>
YELLOW: Zeon pig. On your feet, pig. <br>
(They are wearing armbands with - swastikas! on them, Nazi style, not
peaceful indian style. Kirk starts to move.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the non-interference Directive. <br>
YELLOW: Hold. Your hands above your head, Zeon. Higher. Keep your hands
up so you don't touch anything Ekosian. You swine have defiled us for
the last time. But that's now ended. Move! <br>
(They march him away.) <br>
KIRK: Unbelievable. Do you recognise those uniforms? <br>
SPOCK: Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi
Germany. <br>
(A broadcast comes over a screen hung between two columns of a building
in the street.) <br>
MAN [on screen]: Attention. Attention. Attention. An announcement from
Fuhrer Headquarters. Today, the Fuhrer has ordered our glorious capital
to be made Zeon-free. Starting at dawn, our heroic troops have begun
flushing out the Zeon monsters who've been poisoning our planet. <br>
KIRK: How could this have happened? The chances of another planet
developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols,
the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim. <br>
SPOCK: Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear. <br>
MAN [over images]: The Fuhrer's headquarters reports repulsing an
attack by Zeon spacecraft. Our missiles utterly destroyed the enemy. <br>
KIRK: You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed,
Mister Spock. <br>
CROWD [on screen]: Sieg heil! Sieg heil! <br>
MAN [over images]: At this patriotic demonstration, Deputy Fuhrer
Melakon presented the Iron Cross, second class, to Daras, hero of the
Fatherland. (a blonde woman) Everywhere, preparations go forward toward
the Final Decision, death to Zeon. Long live the Fatherland.
Long live the Fuhrer. <br>
(The camera swings over to a portrait on the studio wall.) <br>
KIRK: That's John Gill. The Fuhrer? <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
SOLDIER: You, Zeons! What kind of monsters are the Zeons sending
against us? <br>
KIRK: You're right. He's not one of us. <br>
SOLDIER: What do you mean? <br>
KIRK: Look at him. <br>
(Kirk karate chops the soldier unconscious and takes his
pistol.)&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: Spock, take his uniform. <br>
SPOCK: You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain? <br>
KIRK: If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach. <br>
SPOCK: That's very well taken, Captain. </font></p>

tin helmet.) <br>
KIRK: That helmet covers a multitude of sins. <br>
(They are accosted by a man in a dark blue uniform and peaked cap.) <br>
OFFICER: Lieutenant, what have we here? A Zeon? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not
correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland? <br>
OFFICER: With all Zeon pigs, Lieutenant. <br>
SPOCK: Take charge of him. <br>
OFFICER: With pleasure. Today we have a surprise planned for you, Zeon.
<br>
(He steps in front of Spock and gets his neck pinched, of course.) <br>
SPOCK: Your uniform, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I
believe. <br>
SPOCK: Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. </font></p>

salute? (Spock salutes.) Your papers. <br>
KIRK: Your orders, Lieutenant. He wants to see your orders in the
jacket. The Lieutenant's a little dazed. He captured several Zeons
single-handed. One of the pigs struck him before he dropped. I promise
you that pig will never get up again. <br>
MAJOR: Good work, Lieutenant. <br>
KIRK: Hail the Fuhrer. <br>
MAJOR: Hail to the Fuhrer. <br>
KIRK: This is a day to remember, Major. <br>
MAJOR: Lieutenant? Better see a doctor. You don't look well. Your
colour. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. I shall tend to it, Major. <br>
MAJOR: Lieutenant! Your helmet. Remove it. <br>
KIRK: We have urgent business with the Fuhrer. <br>
MAJOR: Lieutenant, remove your helmet. <br>

takes off the helmet and gives the Major a Look.) </font></p>

flinching despite the weals and blood on their skin. Green blood in
Spock's case. The man from the street is watching from his cell.) <br>
MAJOR: Enough. do you wish to speak now? Tell me your orders! You were
sent to kill our Fuhrer. Confess! Do you want some more persuasion? <br>
KIRK: You're making this a rather one-sided conversation, Major. <br>
MAJOR: Do not joke with me, Zeon pig. Who is this alien? Things might
go easier if you tell me about him. <br>
KIRK: Let me speak to your Fuhrer. I'll tell him everything he wants to
know. <br>
MAJOR: You'll be glad to talk to me before I'm through. <br>
ENEG: Major. <br>
MAJOR: Ah, Chairman Eneg. Your Excellency, I am honoured. I've been
interrogating these spies, captured in <br>
ENEG: I've had a full report. You are not from Zeon. <br>
SPOCK: Obviously. <br>
ENEG: Where do you come from? <br>
KIRK: I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer. <br>
ENEG: What is your business with the Fuhrer? <br>
KIRK: I'll discuss that only with him. <br>
MAJOR: Pig! You're speaking to the Chairman of the Party. <br>
ENEG: That's enough, Major. What were the weapons found on you? What
design? Our famous SS laboratories have been unable to discover how the
weapons work. <br>
MAJOR: Excellency, give me a few minutes with them. I promise you, I'll
have <br>
ENEG: You've had a few minutes without result. The trouble with you SS
is that you don't realise that punishment becomes ineffective after a
certain point. Men become insensitive. <br>
MAJOR: Yes, Excellency. <br>
ENEG: Lock them up. Let their pain argue with them. Then I will
question them. <br>
MAJOR: Excellency, the standing order is to interrogate and execute.
The interrogation is finished, therefore <br>
ENEG: Finished? What have you learned? Hold them for an hour. <br>
MAJOR: Excellency, the order <br>
ENEG: That is my order, Major. I suggest you do not disobey it. <br>
MAJOR: Yes, Excellency. (Eneg leaves) All right, pigs. I shall keep my
eye on the clock. When the hour is up, you will die most unpleasantly,
I promise you! Lock them up. <br>
(They are put into the cell next to the man from the street.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cell]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: John Gill was the kindest, gentlest man I
ever knew. For him to be a Nazi is impossible. <br>
(As soon as the Nazis have left the room, the other man comes over to
the adjoining bars.) <br>
ISAK: Why did they take you? You're not a Zeon. He certainly is not
one. <br>
Why do the Nazis treat you as enemies? <br>
SPOCK: Why do the Nazis hate Zeons? <br>
ISAK: Why? Because without us to hate, there'd be nothing to hold them
together. So the Party has built us into a threat, a disease to be
wiped out. <br>
SPOCK: Is Zeon a threat to them? <br>
ISAK: Where did you come from? Our warlike period ended dozens of
generations ago. We came here. We thought we were civilising the
Ekosians. <br>
SPOCK: It would seem the assumption was premature. <br>
KIRK: Were they like this when you first came? <br>
ISAK: Warlike, yes, but not vicious. That started when the Nazi
movement began only a few years ago. <br>
SPOCK: That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival. <br>
ISAK: When they've destroyed us here, they will attack our planet.
They'll use the technology we gave them. The danger is that taking life
is so repugnant to our people, I'm afraid we'll go down without a
struggle. But after what I saw in the street today, I think I could
kill. <br>
KIRK: Do you know the plan of this building? <br>
ISAK: Why? <br>
KIRK: If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back,
we might be able to stop the slaughter. <br>
ISAK: Why should you be interested in saving Zeons? <br>
KIRK: We must get our communicators, contact the ship. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard
beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy. <br>
KIRK: The transponders. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. <br>
KIRK: And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders. <br>
(Kirk pulls a metal strip from the bed in the cell, and Spock uses it
to cut into Kirk's arm.) <br>
ISAK: Are you trying to kill yourselves? <br>
(Spock gets Kirk's transponder out, then Kirk tries to extract
Spock's.) <br>
KIRK: I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the
figures computed? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance,
which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres. <br>
(He bends the metal strip accordingly.) <br>
SPOCK: Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately,
there. That is, of course, a crude estimation. <br>
ISAK: What is it you're making, some kind of radio? <br>
KIRK: No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform.
<br>
KIRK: I would be honoured, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to
achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of
physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary
excitation, even using crude natural crystals. <br>
(Kirk squats down and Spock eventually stands on his thighs, leaning
against the well-injured back.) <br>
KIRK: Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back.
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course
be very crude. <br>
KIRK: (in pain) I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just
hurry, please. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, why should I aim at such a structure? <br>
KIRK: Never mind, Spock. Just get on with the job. <br>
(With the crystals presumably in the holes where the strip was fastened
to the bed frame, Spock holds it up to the
light bulb and directs a beam of coherent light at the door lock,
burning through it.) <br>
KIRK: Oh, my goodness. Beautiful. Oh, Spock Spock! (Spock gets down)
Beautiful. Over there. I'll create a commotion. <br>
(Spock goes to hide behind the door to the room) <br>
KIRK: Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll
talk! Guard! Guard, I'll talk! <br>
(A guard enters.) <br>
KIRK: Guard, I'll talk. I'll talk. The pain <br>
(Spock neck-pinches the guard. They start to undress him.) <br>
ISAK: Take me with you. Give me a chance to fight them. <br>
SPOCK: May I remind you, we did not intend to fight. <br>
ISAK: Take me with you, or you'll never find the laboratory. <br>
KIRK: Take him with us, Mister Spock. He's got a point. He's our guide.

Nazi comes out of the room and locks the door.) <br>
KIRK: All right, Zeon pigs, move. (He stumbles against the Nazi.) Zeon
pigs. They do nothing right. Don't worry. They're on their way to the
laboratory, for experimental work. They'll pay. Move! <br>

weapon drawn.) <br>
KIRK: (reading a clipboard) The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo
Command Headquarters. Well, that takes care of the phasers. <br>

KIRK: You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough. <br>
ISAK: Yes. With this uniform, we can steal a car, get out of the
capital. <br>
KIRK: We came for John Gill. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate
with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against
the entire military force of this planet. <br>

ABROM: Yes. If we had taken you into our confidence, we could've
betrayed all our people if you'd been Nazi spies. All right, leave us. <br>
ISAK: The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient. We must be very,
very careful in order to survive here. We of the Underground don't know
who our leaders are. That way, if we break under pressure, we can only
betray a handful of our people. <br>
SPOCK: This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her
being decorated. <br>
DARAS: I'm an Ekosian fighting the terrible thing that's happened to my
people. The decoration was for betraying my own father to the Party. It
was my father's idea. You see, he used to be very close to the Fuhrer.
Then he saw the changes and where they were leading. He turned against
the Party. They imprisoned him. Melakon sentenced him to death. <br>
KIRK: Melakon? <br>
ABROM: The Deputy Fuhrer. He's taken over. <br>
DARAS: My father denounced me, making it appear like I'd betrayed him.
He gave me a weapon to continue the fight with. <br>
KIRK: How could this have seemed right to John Gill? <br>
ABROM: Who? <br>
KIRK: John Gill, your Fuhrer. He's one of our people. <br>
ABROM: And what is your people? <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. This
is my first officer, Mister Spock. John Gill, your Fuhrer, was sent
here by the Federation as a cultural observer. <br>
DARAS: You mean that the Fuhrer is an alien? <br>
SPOCK: That is correct. <br>
DARAS: I grew up to admire him, later to hate and despise everything he
stands for. But I always thought he was one of us. Now to hear that
he's an alien sent here to destroy us <br>
KIRK: That was not his mission, ever. He was sent here to observe, not
to interfere. Something went wrong, and that's why we're here. To find
out and to correct. We must see him. <br>
ISAK: It's impossible. Even if this were another time, it still would
be impossible. He sees no one. No one but Melakon. He's under maximum
security. <br>
KIRK: Maximum security. Is he so afraid? <br>
ISAK: There are many of us, both Ekosians and younger Zeons, who would
gladly risk our lives to kill him. <br>
KIRK: I don't understand what's going on here. This goes against every
principle that John Gill ever believed in. Our only chance is to see
him, and quickly. <br>
DARAS: He makes a speech tonight from the Chancellery. All the top
Party officials will be there. <br>
KIRK: Will you be there? <br>
DARAS: Of course. As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the
Fatherland. <br>
SPOCK: As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the
guards. <br>
DARAS: Only the top, most trusted, officials will be allowed in. The
country will watch on the viewscreens. <br>
ISAK: I'm afraid it will be a formal declaration of war against Zeon.
Their Final Solution. <br>
KIRK: You must get us in there. <br>
DARAS: It would be suicide. <br>
ISAK: Well it's a risk living at all the way things are going. If the
Captain believes he has a chance, I'm willing to commit suicide with
him. <br>

interfere with this culture? <br>

Nazis were. <br>

defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global
domination. <br>

cost. Why that example? <br>

accomplish its efficiency without sadism. <br>

to run away from us, sir. <br>
KIRK: Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.<br>
SULU: No, sir.<br>
KIRK: Earth ship, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam
from it.<br>
SCOTT: If it is, he'll soon overload his engines.<br>
SPOCK: Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard. <br>
SULU: Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.<br>
KIRK: Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?<br>
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. He refuses to answer. Unless
he's not receiving us. <br>
KIRK: He's receiving us alright. <br>
SPOCK: Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three
five. <br>

SULU: He's seen the asteroids too, sir. <br>
KIRK: Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them. <br>
SULU: If one hits him. <br>
SPOCK: Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J
cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. <br>
KIRK: Try to warn him. If he loses power now <br>
FARRELL: There go his engines, sir. <br>
SULU: He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain. <br>
FARRELL: He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, if we try, we'll overload our own engines. He's too far
away. <br>
KIRK: Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty,
Spock, stand by in the transporter room. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (they leave) <br>
FARRELL: We're protecting him, sir. We won't be able to hold it long. <br>

danger line. <br>

much longer. (lights flicker)<br>

onto. <br>

evade you. And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when
you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids. <br>
KIRK: Your name, please. <br>

Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information
you may need for your defence. <br>

going to see skinned. <br>

through it. <br>

MUDD: Leo Francis Walsh. <br>
COMPUTER: Incorrect. <br>
SPOCK: Your correct name. <br>
MUDD: Gentlemen, surely you're not going to take the word of a soulless
mechanical device over that of a real flesh and blood man. <br>
SPOCK: State your correct name for the record. <br>
MUDD: Harry Mudd. <br>
COMPUTER: Incorrect. <br>
MUDD: Harcourt Fenton Mudd. <br>

COMPUTER: Full data coming on screen.
<br>
RUTH: If it can read our minds, too. <br>
MUDD: It can't, darling. It can't. Just what's on the record.
<br>
COMPUTER: Offense record. Smuggling. Sentence suspended. Transport of
stolen goods. Purchase of space vessel with counterfeit currency.
Sentences, psychiatric treatment, effectiveness disputed. <br>
KIRK: Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight
plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a
starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation. <br>
MUDD: What? My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation?
<br>
KIRK: You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's
license. <br>
MUDD: Untrue! I have a master's ticket. <br>
COMPUTER: Incorrect. Master's license revoked Stardate 1116.4. <br>
MUDD: All right. Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain
on this trip, passed away suddenly. Well, I had no choice but to take
out me ship me own self. I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him.
In memoriam, as it were. A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward. <br>
KIRK: Destination and purpose of journey? <br>
MUDD: Planet Ophiuchus 3. Wiving settlers. <br>
KIRK: Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what? <br>
MUDD: I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task. <br>
KIRK: Data on witnesses. <br>
COMPUTER: No data. <br>
KIRK: Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings? <br>
COMPUTER: No decipherable reading on females. However, unusual reading
on male board members. Detecting high respiration patterns,
perspiration rate up, heartbeat rapid, blood pressure higher than
normal. <br>
KIRK: Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record. <br>
MUDD: You see, gentlemen, just as I told you. Three lovely ladies
destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to
supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed. A
wife, a home, a family. Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred
public trust. I've devoted me whole life to it. <br>
COMPUTER: Incorrect. <br>
MUDD: Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it. <br>
KIRK: Did these ladies come voluntarily? <br>
MUDD: Well, of course! Now, for example, Ruthie here comes from a
pelagic planet, sea ranchers. Magda there from the helium experimental
station. <br>
EVE: It's the same story for all of us, Captain. No men. Mine was a
farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to
cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on their boots
every time they walked in. <br>
MUDD: Fine, Evie. Fine. <br>
EVE: It's not fine! We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting
for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction!
Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something. <br>
MUDD: That's enough, Evie. <br>
KIRK: The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a
vessel. Do you have any defence to offer? <br>
MUDD: Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you. <br>
KIRK: The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal
authorities at our earliest opportunity. <br>
EVE: And what about us? What happens to us? Help us, please. All of us.

SULU: Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support
system is now on batteries. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will
you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the
lithium crystals immediately upon arrival. (all officers leave) <br>
MUDD: Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well,
girls, lithium miners. Don't you understand? Lonely, isolated,
overworked, rich lithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands,
hmm? Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain. I'll get
you a man who can buy you a whole planet. Maggie, you're going to be a
countess. Ruth, I'll make you a duchess. And I, I'll be running this
starship. Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be

slightly lined) Look at my face. <br>
MAGDA: Give us the pills. <br>
RUTH: What if someone sees us like this? <br>
EVE: You'll never find them, Harry, and if you do find them you know
what they are. A cheat. If you care for someone, really care <br>
MUDD: (ransacking drawers frantically) For whom, Evie? For Kirk? You'll
find out that Ship's captains are already married, girl, to their
vessels. You'd find out the first time you came between him and the
ship. You'll see. <br>
RUTH: I'm going back to what I was. Ugly. <br>
MAGDA: I can't stand myself like this. <br>
RUTH: Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us? <br>
MUDD: I didn't hide them, girl. I put them in a safe place in case I
was searched. <br>
MADGA: Find the pill, Harry! <br>
MUDD: Mattress! Yes, here! (Ruth and Magda devour them eagerly) Go on,
Eve. Take it. It's not a cheat. It's a miracle for some man who can
appreciate it and who needs it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful.
Destroying them was a shame.&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium
crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come.
<br>
SECURITY: Sir. Mining Chief Childress and Mister Gossett. <br>
KIRK: Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise.
This is my science officer Mister Spock. <br>
CHILDRESS: Let's get right to business. You want lithium crystals and
we've got them. <br>
KIRK: Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price. <br>
CHILDRESS: We're not sure they're for sale, Captain. We might prefer a
swap. <br>
KIRK: What did you have in mind? <br>
CHILDRESS: Mudd's women. <br>
GOSSETT: If we like them. We'd like to have a look at them first of
course. <br>
CHILDRESS: Right. Trot them out, Captain. Oh, and Harry Mudd. Either
way, I've agreed to have him released. Charges dropped. <br>
KIRK: (laughs) Is there anything else? <br>
CHILDRESS: You've got no choice, Kirk. You beam a landing party down,
and you won't find one blessed crystal. <br>
KIRK: No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need
medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider
those facts too? <br>
MUDD: Come along, ladies, come along. You must be Ben Childress. Come
on now, girls, come on. <br>
RUTH: And you must be Herm Gossett. <br>
GOSSETT: Yes, I reckon I am. <br>
CHILDRESS: One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you're not a liar. Ladies,
you are welcome. <br>
KIRK: It's still no deal. <br>
SPOCK: Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. <br>
MUDD: I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they
start spiraling in. I do hate to see you suffering such a situation,
Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal. Sooner
or later, you'll have to.

SPOCK: We don't have the time to spare, Captain. <br>
KIRK: You got a better idea? <br>
CHILDRESS: (to Eve) Blows like that all the time. You can get lost a
dozen feet from your doorstep. The wind comes up sudden.
Magnetic storm. That means the wind will really rip soon. <br>
MAGDA: Dance with me. <br>
CHILDRESS: Would you like to dance? <br>
EVE: No, I (coughs) No. I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust. <br>

instead) <br>

those crystals. <br>
KIRK: But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way.
Satisfied, Mister Scott? <br>
UHURA: Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems
worse. <br>

EVE: I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores. <br>
CHILDRESS: And I do my own cooking. I've not laid a hand on you.
Remember that. <br>
EVE: Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy,
and it's still the same song. There. You going to eat or talk? <br>
CHILDRESS: I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes. Ooh,
female cooking again. I've tasted better, by my own hand. <br>
EVE: Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers
of your leavings out of that pan. <br>
CHILDRESS: You find me a well, some decent water, then talk. <br>
EVE: Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand
blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that? <br>

EVE: Not in double jack. <br>
CHILDRESS: You're not only plain as an old bucket, you're not even good
company. What the devil happened to your looks, anyway? <br>

didn't touch her. <br>

MUDD: Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug. <br>
EVE: Harmless! <br>
MUDD: Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well,
with men, it makes them more muscular. Women, rounder. Men, more
aggressive. Women, more feminine, and <br>

EVE: Yes, that's what it means! <br>
CHILDRESS: What happened to my partners? <br>

They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get
out of it. <br>

CHILDRESS: Why? <br>
MUDD: You can't condemn the women. <br>
CHILDRESS: I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies. We all almost
die. We should have, but we didn't. And now that we've got the good
life in our hands, you bring us women for wives that <br>
EVE: You don't want wives, you want this. This is what you want, Mister
Childress. I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't
have it. It's not real! (takes the pills) Is this the kind of wife you
want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry
and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you
really want? All right, then. Here it is. <br>
KIRK: Quite a woman, eh, Childress? <br>
CHILDRESS: A fake, pumped up by a drug. <br>
KIRK: By herself. She took no drug. <br>
EVE: I swallowed it. <br>
KIRK: Coloured gelatin. <br>

EVE: But that can't be. <br>

MUDD: Or man, for that matter. <br>
KIRK: You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right
Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those
lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Stand by. Do I beam down a search party? <br>
CHILDRESS: No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them. <br>

EVE: You've got someone up there called the Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd. <br>
MUDD: Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave
me behind here? On this planet that would be punishment enough. <br>
KIRK: I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness
at your trial. If you think that'll help. <br>

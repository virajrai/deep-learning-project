Captain's log, stardate 5693.2. The Enterprise is approaching the last
reported position of the star ship Defiant,
which vanished without trace three weeks ago. We are in unsurveyed

SPOCK: Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all
sensors. <br>
KIRK: Specify. <br>
SPOCK: I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is
literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account
for these readings. <br>
KIRK: What about sensor failure? <br>
SPOCK: Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems. <br>
SCOTT: Captain. We're losing power in the warp engines. <br>
KIRK: How bad is it? <br>
SCOTT: We can barely read it, but I don't like the looks of it. And I
cannot find out the cause. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain. Visual detection of an object dead ahead. <br>
KIRK: How about it, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: Explain. <br>
SPOCK: There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace
of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there. <br>
(As they close in, the bright fuzzy thing on the screen becomes
recognizable.) <br>
KIRK: The Defiant! Mister Sulu, impulse engines only. Close to
transporter range. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency. <br>
UHURA: I've been trying to raise them, sir. There is no response. <br>
SULU: Just within transporter range, sir. <br>
KIRK: Good. Maintain position. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with
me. Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately. Scotty,
you have the conn. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir.

SPOCK: Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign. <br>
MCCOY: Jim. The Captain's neck is broken. <br>
SPOCK: The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume
the mutineers are somewhere aboard. <br>

KIRK: Odd, Mister Spock. Very odd. Spock, you stay here with me.
Chekov, get down to Engineering and life support systems. Doctor McCoy,
check out the Sickbay. Kirk to Enterprise. Cancel the security squad

CHEKOV: It's gone. The Defiant just vanished. <br>
(Scott and O'Neil start fiddling with the innards of the transporter
console.) <br>
SCOTT: Anything? <br>
SPOCK: Negative. <br>
SCOTT: That's it. I've done all I can. There's nothing out there to
grab a hold of and bring in. When that ship went, it must have taken
the Captain with it.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COMPUTER: Computer working. <br>
SPOCK: Compute the next period of spatial interphase. <br>
COMPUTER: Next interphase two hours twelve minutes. <br>
SCOTT: Two hours and twelve minutes? That power leak has unbalanced the
ship and she's starting to drift. I can't hold her in place that long. <br>
SPOCK: We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak
here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the
Captain alive. <br>
CHEKOV: I don't understand what's so special about this region of
space. <br>
SPOCK: Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe
which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space.
At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an
area of ours. That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect
with the Defiant's universe. <br>
UHURA: Mister Spock? We will be able to retrieve the Captain at that
time, won't we? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is
totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not
extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped
ourselves. <br>
UHURA: I see. <br>
CHEKOV: And die like him? <br>
(Chekov leaps up, pushes Spock away and, screaming, attacks Sulu. Scott
grabs him and McCoy arrives to help. Spock grabs his face.) <br>
SPOCK: Chekov! Chekov! <br>
(Spock neck-pinches him into silence.) <br>
SPOCK: Security guards to the Bridge. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
MCCOY: What happened, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our
problems in this situation when he attacked. <br>
MCCOY: Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before
this? <br>
SULU: I think he had several spasms of pain. <br>
MCCOY: Did he seem to be getting hysterical? <br>
UHURA: Doctor, he seemed more angry than frightened. <br>
SCOTT: He had no cause to be angry. <br>
(Security arrive.) <br>
MCCOY: Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint. <br>
(Scott and the security guards leave with Chekov.) <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov.
The same fury which was evident in the Defiant. <br>
MCCOY: That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew
of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable. <br>
SPOCK: Is there anything you need to isolate the cause? <br>
MCCOY: Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise
precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant. <br>
SPOCK: If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move. <br>
MCCOY: How long will that take? <br>
SPOCK: Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive? <br>
SPOCK: The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant
phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and
survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the
precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there
can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide
breathable air for no more than three point six two hours. <br>
SULU: Mister Spock. A vessel approaching on an intercept vector. <br>
SPOCK: Status, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Range two hundred thousand kilometres. Velocity zero point five
one C. <br>

SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. Red Alert. All decks, go to Red Alert. <br>
SULU: They've stopped dead, sir. Range ninety thousand kilometres and
holding. <br>
UHURA: Mister Spock? I'm receiving a visual signal. <br>
SPOCK: Transfer to main viewer. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
(A strange, garish orange figure with triangular eyes (possibly)
appears against a blue and pink tie-die background.) <br>
LOSKENE [on viewscreen]: I am Commander Loskene. You are trespassing in
a territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly. You must leave this area
immediately. <br>
SPOCK: Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise.
Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space. <br>
LOSKENE [on viewscreen]: We claim this territory and are prepared to
use force, if necessary, to protect our property. <br>
SPOCK: We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise
is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is
currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us? <br>
LOSKENE [on viewscreen]: I find no evidence of a disabled ship. My
instruments indicate ours are the only two vessels in this area. <br>
SPOCK: The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in
one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then. <br>
LOSKENE [on viewscreen]: Very well, Enterprise. In the interest of
interstellar amity, we will wait precisely one hour and fifty
three minutes. But be correct. We do not tolerate deceit.

MCCOY: You should've known what could've happened and done everything
in your power to safeguard your crew. That is the mark of a starship
Captain, like Jim. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons.
Please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects
of this space. That is your primary task, since we must remain here. <br>
(McCoy leaves.) <br>
SULU: Mister Spock, something has just entered sensor range. It's
another Tholian, sir. Loskene must've contacted them when he tried to
intercept us. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
SULU: Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir? <br>
SPOCK: Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the
approaching vessel? <br>
UHURA: They're refusing reception. I can't <br>
SPOCK: Distance, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Just beyond phaser range, sir. <br>
UHURA: What is that? <br>
(The two Tholian ships have joined stern to stern, and are now moving
apart, drawing a thread of some sort out between them. Then they come
back across the viewscreen creating two more lines.) <br>
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in
all sensors to the ship's library computer console.
Switch scanners. <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br>
(Five horizontal lines on the viewscreen.) <br>
SPOCK: There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology.
It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in
completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we
shall not see home again. <br>
(Now the Tholians are adding diagonal lines to the web.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spock stands on a raised platform, behind a
lectern. Crew and officers are filing in.) <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this
space was negative. <br>
MCCOY: It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most
promising substance tested so far. We're progressing.
<br>
SPOCK: The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory. <br>
MCCOY: My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not
affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my
personal attention, Mister Spock. <br>
(He sits next to Scott.) <br>
SPOCK: A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the
Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance
of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for
them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know
the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that
time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return
the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has
been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact
that Captain Kirk is no longer alive. <br>
(A crewman goes berserk and is carried out by three security men.) <br>
MCCOY: Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint. <br>
SPOCK: I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and
admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the
loss in the privacy of your own thoughts. <br>
SCOTT: Attention. (a respectful pause) Dismissed. <br>
(Everyone starts to file out.) <br>
MCCOY: There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which
requires our presence. <br>
SPOCK: It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on
the bridge. <br>
MCCOY: The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be
reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just
declared Jim dead. <br>
SPOCK: It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status? <br>
SPOCK: The mental and physical state of this crew are your
responsibility, Doctor. At the moment, they are your top priority. <br>
MCCOY: The Captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour
that order before you take over. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Kirk's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: (looking at a medal) He was a hero in every
sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing. The one
thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the
Enterprise. Now you've made that impossible, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Maybe not the same one. I really came here to find out why you
stayed and fought. <br>
SPOCK: The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the
risk of his own life or even his own ship. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision
to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have
assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to
stay. Why? <br>
SPOCK: I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of
this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While
there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the
Captain's status. <br>
MCCOY: You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of
that. <br>
SPOCK: That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have
to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into. <br>
SPOCK: You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our
responsibilities here. <br>
MCCOY: There's no hurry, Mister Spock. The antidote probably doesn't
concern you. Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time. <br>
(Spock enters the combination to the Captain's safe.) <br>
MCCOY: I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't
believe that you would want Jim's command.
You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a
medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise. <br>
MCCOY: I would like to remedy that situation. <br>
SPOCK: If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of
duty. That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship. <br>
KIRK [on monitor]: Bones, Spock. since you are playing this tape, we
will assume that I am dead, that the tactical situation is critical,
and both of you are locked in mortal combat. It means, Spock, that you
have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult
decisions of your career. I can offer only one small piece of advice,
for whatever it's worth. Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you
have to save the ship. But temper your judgment with intuitive insight.
I believe you have those qualities, but if you can't find them in
yourself, seek out McCoy. Ask his advice. And if you find it sound,
take it. Bones, you've heard what I've just told Spock. Help him if you
can. But remember he is the Captain. His decisions must be followed
without question. You might find that he is capable of human insight
and human error. They are most difficult to defend, but you will find
that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence each of you
have given me. Take care. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, I, er, I'm sorry. It does hurt, doesn't it? <br>
SPOCK: What would you have me say, Doctor? <br>
(The intercom whistles.) <br>
SPOCK: Spock here. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Mister Spock, we have a readout on the Tholian tractor
field. I think we can estimate its approximate completion time. <br>
SPOCK: I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our
respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs.

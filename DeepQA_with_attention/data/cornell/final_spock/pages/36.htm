<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A woman is doing a belly-dance, complete with
finger-cymbals, while the patrons lounge on cushions. The audience are
appreciating the show.) <br>
SCOTT: Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius. <br>
KIRK: Obviously a man of good taste. <br>
SCOTT: You mean to tell me all these women, that all this is <br>
KIRK: Yes, yes, yes. The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure.
<br>
MCCOY: That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a
completely hedonistic society. <br>
KIRK: Do you like her, Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. Why shouldn't I? <br>
KIRK: Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you
might like to meet her. <br>
SCOTT: Now that's what I call a real Captain. Always thinking of his
men. <br>
(The dancer comes over, bends over backwards then does a shimmy before
returning to the small stage to finish. Scotty bangs on the table in
applause.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights. <br>
SCOTT: Now no one has to tell an old Aberdeen pub-crawler how to
applaud, Captain. <br>
(She comes over, but the man at the next table doesn't look too pleased
with the situation.) <br>
KIRK: Have one of our pillows? <br>
(The man leaves as she sits.) <br>
SCOTT: 'Tis a fine foggy night tonight, and I doubt if anyone's ever
told you of the marvellous fogs we have in Aberdeen. <br>
KARA: Never a word, but I'm dying to learn. <br>
SCOTT: Well then, why don't I show you? There's nothing like a walk in
the fog with a bonny lass. <br>
KARA: Or a handsome gentleman. Why don't we? <br>
SCOTT: You don't mind, do you? I might even get back to the ship on
time. <br>
KIRK: We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself.
(Scott and Kara leave) My work is never done. <br>
MCCOY: My work, Jim. This is prescription stuff. Don't forget, the
explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman. <br>
KIRK: Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that? <br>
MCCOY: Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, considerable psychological
damage could have been caused. For example, his total resentment toward
women. <br>
KIRK: He seems he's overcoming his resentment. <br>
MCCOY: Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the
ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius. But then he
will have lost total resentment toward women. <br>
KIRK: Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know
a little place across town where the women <br>
MCCOY: Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Street]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The fog hangs very low on Argelius - somewhere
just below knee level. Couples are meandering along lost in each other.
Kirk works out which way to go, then suddenly - a scream splits the
night. They run towards it and find the dancer on the ground.) <br>
MCCOY: She's dead, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Stabbed, a dozen times. <br>
(And standing by a wall, groaning, with a bloody knife in his hand, is
Montgomery Scott.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 3614.9. Planet Argelius
Two. While on therapeutic shore leave, Mister Scott has fallen under
suspicion of having brutally murdered an Argelian woman. The chief city
administrator, Mister Hengist, has taken charge of the investigation,
but has learned little of value.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cafe]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HENGIST: (a neat man in a suit) I don't know what
to say, gentlemen. Argelius is the last planet in the
galaxy I'd expect a thing like this to happen. <br>
KIRK: We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist. <br>
HENGIST: If this was my home planet, Rigel Four, I'd have a dozen
investigators working on the matter, but they don't exist here. <br>
MCCOY: You're not a native of Argelius, sir? <br>
HENGIST: Oh, no. Argelius hires its administrative officers from other
planets. The Argelians aren't very efficient, you know. Gentle,
harmless people. Mister Scott. Mister Scott? Now, are you sure you've
never seen this before? (the knife) <br>
SCOTT: I, I don't remember. <br>
HENGIST: Really, sir. That is hardly helpful. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that?
What happened next? <br>
SCOTT: We were walking in the fog. I was up ahead trying to lead the
way. I heard the girl scream. I remember starting to turn.
I don't remember another thing. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, you've got to remember. <br>
MCCOY: Jim. (they move off a little way) If he says he can't remember,
he probably doesn't. You know Scotty. <br>
KIRK: I know a murder's been committed. <br>
MCCOY: You don't think by any chance that Scotty <br>
KIRK: It doesn't make any difference what I think. <br>
MCCOY: But you don't just throw him to the wolves. <br>
KIRK: Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under
Argelian jurisdiction. If they want to arrest him, try him, even
convict him, I have to go along with it. <br>
MCCOY: But he's suffering from a severe concussion. <br>
KIRK: We'll do what we can. <br>
HENGIST: It's not promising, Captain. Mister Scott insists he remembers
nothing, but my detector readings indicates that only his fingerprints
are on the murder weapon. <br>
KIRK: Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about
the time of the murder. Several of them left just before Mister Scott
and the girl did. <br>
HENGIST: So I've been informed by the staff. They're being located and
we will question them. But the outlook for your friend is quite grim. <br>
KIRK: What's the law in these cases? <br>
JARIS: The law of Argelius is love. <br>
(An elegant grey-haired man enters, with a woman.) <br>
HENGIST: Gentlemen, our prefect, Jaris. Sir, Captain Kirk, Doctor
McCoy. <br>
JARIS: And this is my wife, Sybo. <br>
HENGIST: And this man is Scott, the one I sent you the message about. <br>
JARIS: He does not look like a man capable of such an act. Still, it's
been so long. Gentlemen, before our great awakening two hundred years
ago,
we had ways of learning the truth in such matters. We shall return to
them. <br>
MCCOY: The Argelian empathic contact? <br>
JARIS: You know of this? <br>
KIRK: Yes, we've heard of it. I assumed it was a lost art. <br>
JARIS: My wife is a descendent of the ancient priestesses of our land.
She has the ancestral gift. Gentlemen, I have come to invite you to my
home. <br>
HENGIST: Prefect, don't you think this should be handled in an official
manner through my office? <br>
JARIS: It shall be handled in an official manner, Mister Hengist, since
I am the highest official. Gentlemen, let us proceed to my home where,
with the aid of my wife, we shall learn the truth. Please. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Jaris' home]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The middle eastern theme continues with spiral
columns, onion-dome arches, latticed windows and plenty of cushions.) <br>
KIRK: Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well,
Prefect, but there's only one way we can find out what it is Mister
Scott cannot remember.
Since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship, I can
beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder. <br>
MCCOY: Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's
happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours. <br>
HENGIST: Oh, I'd advise against it, Prefect. This is purely an Argelian
matter. <br>
JARIS: My wife must meditate for a time before she's ready. I see no
reason why we should not use that time to good advantage. Very well,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Kirk out. <br>
MCCOY: Prefect, the psycho-tricorder will require privacy to be
effective. <br>
JARIS: There is a small chamber below this room. Perhaps that will
suffice. Captain, news of this frightful murder is spreading among my
people. They're greatly disturbed. I have already heard talk of closing
Argelius to space vehicles. <br>
KIRK: Well, that would be most unfortunate. Argelian hospitality is
well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port. <br>
JARIS: Yes. I believe it's the only one in the quadrant. (hands out
drinks) Captain. <br>
HENGIST: There are other people we should question. Perhaps I should go
expedite their arrival here? <br>
JARIS: Yes, please do so, Mister Hengist. Anyone with any connection
with this murder should be present at the ceremony. <br>
(A woman beams down as Hengist leaves.) <br>
KAREN: Lieutenant Karen Tracy reporting as ordered, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, I want a twenty four hour regressive memory check
made on Mister Scott. <br>
KAREN: Yes, Captain. Where shall I set up? <br>
JARIS: If you'll Just follow me, Lieutenant. <br>
(Jaris and Karen leave.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty, co-operate completely with Lieutenant Tracy. Maybe we'll
clear this thing up. <br>
SCOTT: I certainly hope so, sir. I can't stand this not knowing.
(leaves) <br>
MCCOY: Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done
such a thing. <br>
KIRK: But that blow on the head. It could put all his previous
behaviour patterns into the junk heap. <br>
MCCOY: Of course, there's another possibility. <br>
KIRK: Explain. <br>
MCCOY: Hysterical amnesia. When a man feels guilty about something,
something too terrible to remember, he blots it out of his conscious
memory. <br>
(Jaris returns and crosses to another doorway.) <br>
JARIS: Are you ready, Sybo? <br>
SYBO: I am ready. May I have the knife, please? <br>
JARIS: Certainly. Among other gifts, Sybo has the ability to receive
impressions from inanimate objects. Do you have it, Captain? <br>
KIRK: The knife? No. <br>
JARIS: But I put it here when we arrived. It's gone. <br>
(A woman's scream fills the air.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Karen Tracy is lying face down on the floor, and
Scott is slumped unconscious in a chair.) <br>
KIRK: Scotty. <br>
MCCOY: She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one. <br>
KIRK: Stabbed over and over again. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Jaris' home]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JARIS: (to Scott) Drink this. An Argelian
stimulant, Doctor. Quite effective and quite harmless. <br>
MCCOY: Go ahead, Scotty. <br>
SCOTT: Lieutenant? Captain? Where's <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Tracy is dead, Scott. You were found alone in the
room. <br>
SCOTT: Dead? But I <br>
KIRK: What happened down there? <br>
SCOTT: I was sitting there. She was taking her readings, and now I'm
sitting here. <br>
MCCOY: Is that all that happened? <br>
SCOTT: I tell you, I don't remember. I must have passed out. <br>
MCCOY: It could be, Jim. That head injury. <br>
KIRK: That head injury. Think, Scotty. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, I've been trying. I can't even believe this is really
happening. <br>
KIRK: There's no way into that place from up here. Prefect, is there
another entrance to that chamber? <br>
JARIS: Yes, there's a door that leads into the garden, but it's been
locked for years. <br>
MCCOY: Locks can be picked, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Check it. <br>
(McCoy leaves and Hengist enters. He is accompanied by the man from the
next table and one of the musicians.) <br>
HENGIST: Prefect, both of these men were at the cafe the night of the
murder. <br>
KIRK: Where've they been during the past few minutes? <br>
HENGIST: Captain, if you don't mind please. <br>
KIRK: There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew. <br>
JARIS: The same as Kara. <br>
HENGIST: Why, that's terrible. (to the man from the next table) You, my
men picked you up near there. What were you doing? <br>
MORLA: Please, I know nothing about it. I didn't kill anyone. <br>
HENGIST: Well, how was the girl killed? <br>
KIRK: Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon. <br>
HENGIST: If only I had facilities. <br>
KIRK: You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered
girl. <br>
TARK: Since she was a little girl, she danced for me. She was my
daughter. Prefect, how could this thing have happened here? The man who
did it must be found. He must be punished. <br>
KIRK: And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara. <br>
JARIS: Is this true? Who are you? <br>
MORLA: Morla of Cantaba Street, Prefect. I was there. I have nothing to
hide. <br>
KIRK: Did you know Kara? <br>
TARK: Of course he knew her. They were to be married, but he behaved
disgracefully. Unheard of. He was jealous of her. <br>
JARIS: That is very disquieting. <br>
MORLA: I know it was wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. I loved
her, and when she went over to the table with these men, I could not
stand to watch, so I left and went home. <br>
KIRK: Jealousy has often been a motive for murder. <br>
JARIS: Yes, I know. That is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved
of here. <br>
MORLA: Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't. <br>
JARIS: We shall see, Morla. <br>
MCCOY: Sorry, Jim. The lock may or may not have been picked. It would
be hard to tell even with the tricorder. <br>
KIRK: Can you prove you went directly home? <br>
HENGIST: Captain, may I continue with the questions please? <br>
KIRK: Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there. <br>
JARIS: Captain, Captain. You're behaving very much like a man who is
desperately trying anything to save his friend. Would you be as
desperate to save Argelius as a space port for your Starfleet? <br>
KIRK: Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent.
And he hasn't been proven guilty. <br>
HENGIST: Need I remind you of the circumstances, Captain? In both
cases, your friend Scott was discovered over the body and later claimed
to remember nothing. <br>
SYBO: I am ready, Jaris. <br>
JARIS: Gentlemen, sit down please. <br>
(Everyone sits around the central brazier.) <br>
KIRK: On one condition, Prefect. That the room be sealed so that no one
can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on. <br>
JARIS: (he flicks a row of switches and the doorways are closed) The
room is sealed. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, you mean my neck is going to have to depend on some
spooky mumbo jumbo? <br>
(Kirk's communicator beeps.) <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. (moves away from the group) Yes,
Mister Spock? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Concerning the situation you related to us.
In my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting
phenomenon, but the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: What do you suggest, Mister Spock? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: These are a proud people. They have their own
customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them. It
is absolutely imperative
that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law. Is that clear? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Quite clear, Captain. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: I don't like it any more than you do, Spock,
but there's nothing we can do about it. Kirk out, <br>
(Everyone is holding hands around the brazier.) <br>
SYBO: Let us begin. Let the circle not be broken. Concentrate upon the
flame which burns upon the altar of truth. <br>
Yes, there is something here. Something terrible. I feel its presence.
Fear, anger, hatred. Anger feeds the flame. Oh! Oh! There is evil here.
Monstrous, terrible evil. Consuming hunger. Hatred of all that lives.
Hatred of women. A hunger that never dies. It is strong, overpowering.
An ancient terror. It has a name. Beratis, Kesla, Redjac! Devouring all
life, all light. A hunger that will never die!
Redjac! Redjac! <br>
(The lights go out, and she screams. When the lights come on again, the
flame has gone out. Scott is standing holding Sybo in his arms, then he
lets her go and she falls forward across McCoy's lap. There is a knife
in her back. <br>
Later...)<br>
KIRK: Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time. <br>
MCCOY: I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply
could not have done it. <br>
KIRK: Normally, no, but that blow on his head could <br>
SCOTT: No, Captain. <br>
KIRK Scotty, I'm sorry. You don't even remember whether you did it or
not. <br>
HENGIST: I agree with you, Captain. I'm perfectly satisfied Mister
Scott is guilty. <br>
KIRK: But not responsible. <br>
HENGIST: That is unproven, sir. <br>
KIRK: We can prove it, if he's insane. <br>
JARIS: Gentlemen, please. How could any man do such monstrous things? <br>
KIRK: That's what we hope to find out, sir. <br>
JARIS: Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: Sir, I swear to you I did not kill your wife or the other
ladies. <br>
HENGIST: By your own admission, you don't know whether you did or
didn't. Your so-called failing memory <br>
KIRK: Mister Hengist. On the Enterprise, we can make a recording of the
registrations of Mister Scott's conscious and subconscious mind.
They will tell us what happened to him in the recent past. <br>
MCCOY: There would be no room for doubt. We would know. And after all,
that's what we're after, isn't it, Prefect? To know? <br>
JARIS: You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
JARIS: If this is so, you may have killed without knowing it. Will your
machines tell us this? <br>
KIRK: No doubt will remain. <br>
JARIS: Very well. We will go to your ship, and he who is guilty will
face the ancient penalties, barbaric and horrible though they may be.
The ancient penalty for murder was death by slow torture. That law has
never been changed. Do you understand that, Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. I understand.

data to the computers for analysis. Shall we begin? <br>
(Jaris nods.) <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, will you take the stand? <br>
(Scott sits on the raised chair and puts his right hand on the sensor
plate. Yet at no time does the camera let us see all his finger.) <br>

COMPUTER: Working. Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott. Serial number
SE-19754-T. Verified. <br>
KIRK: Subject's present physical condition. <br>

Damage healing. Some peripheral abnormalities. <br>
KIRK: Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional

SCOTT: Captain? I didn't black out when Mister Jaris' wife was killed. <br>
KIRK: All right, Scotty, let's have it. <br>
SCOTT: We were holding hands. When the lights went out, the circle was
broken. I heard the poor lady scream, and as I was near the head of the
table anyway I went toward her. But there was something in my way. <br>
KIRK: Something? You mean someone. <br>
SCOTT: No, Captain, some thing. Cold, it was, like a stinking draught
out of a slaughterhouse, but it wasn't really there. Like it. (lost for
words) If you know what I mean. <br>
KIRK: Computer. <br>
COMPUTER: Subject relaying accurate account. No physiological changes. <br>
KIRK: All right. Let's hit it on the head. Scotty, did you kill Sybo? <br>
SCOTT: No, Captain. That I'm sure of. <br>
HENGIST: He's been saying that right along. It means no more now than
it did before. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, lie to me. How old are you? <br>
SCOTT: Twenty two sir. <br>
COMPUTER: Inaccurate. Inaccurate. Data in error. <br>
KIRK: After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your
hand? <br>
SCOTT: Morla on the one side and you on the other, sir. <br>
MORLA: But that doesn't mean anything, Captain, with a room that small.
The lights were out. Anyone would've had time to kill the lady. <br>
HENGIST: But I remind you we found Mister Scott holding her in his
arms, the knife still (to Jaris) I'm sorry, sir, but I must. The knife
still in her back and blood on his hands. <br>
KIRK: The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he
didn't kill her. <br>
HENGIST: There were two other women murdered. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara? <br>
SCOTT: I don't remember. <br>
KIRK: Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? <br>
SCOTT: I don't remember. <br>
KIRK: Computer, accuracy scan. <br>
COMPUTER: Subject relaying accurate account. No physiological changes. <br>
JARIS: All that proves is that he's telling the truth when he says he
doesn't remember. <br>
HENGIST: This is a waste of time. <br>
KIRK: After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder
analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the
surface. That will give us a complete record. Will that satisfy you,
Mister Hengist? <br>
HENGIST: Well, if you can convince me that the machine is incapable of
error, and if it shows he did not kill the women. <br>
KIRK: There will be no error. As for the rest of it, the readings will
show. You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections. <br>
HENGIST: I object to the entire procedure. <br>
JARIS: Mister Hengist, we are here on my authority. We will co-operate.
<br>
HENGIST: Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience <br>
JARIS: For the time being, we will accept Captain Kirk's explanation of
the machine's accuracy as factual. I do, however, reserve to myself the
right to make the final determination. <br>
KIRK: We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand? <br>
(He does so.) <br>
KIRK: Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered? <br>
MORLA: I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry. <br>
SPOCK: Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do
violence? <br>
MORLA: I've never done violence in my life. I don't think I could.
You've got to believe me. I wouldn't kill her. I couldn't. I loved her,
and she loved me. <br>
TARK: That's not true! He might think she loved him, but she didn't.
She told me. He was jealous. All the time. They fought constantly. <br>
KIRK: Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? <br>
MORLA: No. <br>
KIRK: Did you kill Sybo? <br>
MORLA: No. <br>
KIRK: Computer, verification scan. <br>
COMPUTER: Subject relaying accurate account, though some statements
subjective. No physiological changes. <br>
KIRK: All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now. Sybo
spoke of a hunger that never dies. Something that thrives on fear,
terror, death. Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong
way. Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive. That she did sense
something, something evil. <br>
SPOCK: Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact,
Captain. <br>
JARIS: My poor Sybo's talent was genuine, gentlemen. What she told you
was true. <br>
KIRK: All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil,
ancient terror. <br>
MCCOY: That devours all life and light. <br>
KIRK: She said something else, words that didn't make sense. <br>
MCCOY: Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla. <br>
KIRK: Obscure, meaningless words. <br>
SPOCK: To us, perhaps, but to the computer? <br>
KIRK: Ah. Mister Spock, check them out. <br>
SPOCK: Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac.
<br>
COMPUTER: Working. Negative finding. <br>
SPOCK: There is no such word in the linguistics bank? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
SPOCK: Scan all other banks. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. Affirmative. A proper name. <br>
SPOCK: Define. <br>
COMPUTER: Redjac. Source Earth, nineteenth century. Language, English.
Nickname for mass murderer of women. Other Earth synonym, Jack the
Ripper. <br>
KIRK: Jack the Ripper? <br>
HENGIST: That's ridiculous. He lived hundreds of years ago. <br>
TARK: A man couldn't survive all these centuries. <br>
JARIS: Just before she died, my wife said, it is a hunger that never
dies. <br>
TARK: But all men die. <br>
KIRK: Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he
were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper,
which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it? <br>
SPOCK: Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life
forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life
spans, virtually immortal. <br>
KIRK: We know that someone or something killed three women. If it's
impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else. Something
driven to kill. <br>
MCCOY: Sybo said it feeds on death. <br>
SPOCK: In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death.
Even vegetarians. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, but she said more than that. Not just death, but fear. She
said it also feeds on fear. <br>
SPOCK: Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer
was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the
galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the
emotions. <br>
HENGIST: Surely, Prefect, this has gone far enough. Someone, some man
has killed three women. We have the prime suspect in our hands. Are we
going to let him go and start chasing ghosts? <br>
KIRK: No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not
ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities. <br>
SPOCK: Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes.
Correlate hypotheses. Compare with life forms register. Question. Could
such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy? <br>
COMPUTER: The Drella of Alpha Carinae Five derives nourishment from the
emotion of love. There is sufficient precedent for existence of
creature, nature unknown, which could exist on emotion of fear. <br>
SPOCK: Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity. <br>
SPOCK: Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist
without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy
of highly cohesive electromagnetic field. <br>
KIRK: Computer, could the described entity assume physical form? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Precedent, mellitus, cloud creature of Alpha
Majoris One. <br>
HENGIST: Fairy tales. Ghosts and goblins. <br>
KIRK: No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's
gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the
existence of this creature. <br>
SPOCK: I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of
the most populous city of old Earth
and was never identified. <br>
KIRK: Doesn't seem likely, does it? <br>
SPOCK: I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all
but the victim to the presence of the killer. <br>
JARIS: Is that possible? <br>
MCCOY: Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in
nature. <br>
HENGIST: This is fantasy! We all know the murderer is sitting right
here. You're trying to cloud the issue. I've got a mind to <br>
JARIS: I am satisfied the course of this investigation is valid enough.
Please be seated, Mister Hengist. <br>
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without
form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape
to kill. <br>
SPOCK: And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and
more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of
the species. <br>
KIRK: Computer. Criminological files. Cases of unsolved mass murders of
women since Jack the Ripper. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. 1932. Shanghai, China, Earth. Seven women knifed to
death. 1974, Kiev, USSR, Earth. Five women knifed to death.
2105. Martian colonies. Eight women knifed to death. 2156. Heliopolis,
Alpha Eridani Two. Ten women knifed to death. There are additional
examples. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and
Earth. <br>
KIRK: Yes. When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved
with him. Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. Kesla. Name given to unidentified mass murderer of
women on planet Deneb Two. Beratis. Name given to unidentified mass
murderer of women on planet Rigel Four. Additional data. Murders on
Rigel Four occurred one solar year ago. <br>
(All heads turn towards Mister Hengist) <br>
KIRK: You come from Rigel Four. <br>
HENGIST: Well, many people do. It's not a crime. <br>
KIRK: No, but what we're investigating is. Would you mind taking the
stand, Mister Hengist? <br>
HENGIST: I will not. <br>
JARIS: Mister Hengist. <br>
HENGIST: Prefect, this has gone far enough. I will not take the stand. <br>
SPOCK: I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil
disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what
better position from which to kill with impunity? <br>
MCCOY: Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife
was missing. <br>
KIRK: And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered. <br>
SPOCK: An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect
hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the
inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry
wolf in that fold. <br>
HENGIST: Gentlemen, I know something of the law. You're engaging in
sheer speculation. <br>
KIRK: Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon. <br>
SPOCK: Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A. <br>
COMPUTER: Working. Exhibit A on visual. Composition of blade, boridium.
Composition of handle, murinite. Details of carving on handle
conform to folk art forms, indicating place of origin. <br>
SPOCK: Specify. Point of origin. <br>
COMPUTER: Artefact produced by hill people of Argus River region,
planet Rigel Four. <br>
KIRK: Now then, Mister Hengist <br>
(But Hengist tries to make a break for it, even landing a very good
kick on Kirk, who repays him with an even better right cross. Hengist
falls to the floor.) <br>
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim. <br>
KIRK: But that's impossible. <br>
(The lights dim eerily.) <br>
VOICE [OC]: Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! (maniacal laughter)
<br>
(The lights come back.) <br>
SPOCK: The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is
unquestionably controlling it. <br>
KIRK: And the computer controls the ship. <br>
VOICE [OC]: Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! <br>
MCCOY: Scotty, give me a hand. (They prop Hengist up on a chair,
leaning against the table.) <br>
SPOCK: It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked. <br>
KIRK: Audio cut off, Spock. <br>
SCOTT: Captain! <br>
(The viewscreen has an image of hot swirling flames or lava. Anyway, it
is fear-inducing.) <br>
TANKRIS: (a lady yeoman) What's happening, Captain? <br>
JARIS: What does it mean? <br>
KIRK: It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship,
including the life support systems. <br>
MORLA: You mean it could kill us all? <br>
SPOCK: Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on
fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard
this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills.
<br>
KIRK: All hands, this is the captain. Stay at your posts. Remain calm.
Captain out. Bones. What's the sedative situation? <br>
MCCOY: I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano. <br>
KIRK: Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back
that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the
computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me. </font></p>

solved? <br>

to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid. <br>
SULU: With an armful of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a
supernova. <br>

KIRK: Implement. <br>
SPOCK: Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the
last digit the value of pi. <br>
VOICE [OC]: No, no, no, no! No, no! <br>
SPOCK: As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without
resolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the
exclusion of all else until we order it to stop. <br>
KIRK: Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while. The Argelians
will be the first to panic. Let's get back to the briefing room. <br>

MCCOY: If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere
else. <br>

SPOCK: Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled. <br>
KIRK: Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered
a tranquillised body? <br>
MCCOY: Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than
that. <br>
KIRK: You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris? <br>
MCCOY: And you and Mister Spock, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mister Spock. Better give
yourself a shot, Doc. <br>

as he walks along.) <br>
NORMAN: Good morning, sir, Doctor. <br>
SPOCK: Something wrong? <br>
MCCOY: Yes. There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite
pinpoint it. <br>
SPOCK: Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has
only been aboard seventy two hours. <br>
MCCOY: I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't. <br>
SPOCK: Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments. <br>
MCCOY: All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles,
whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who
won't talk about his background. <br>
SPOCK: I see. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all
the difference. <br>
SPOCK: I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic. <br>
MCCOY: Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he
has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam
without reason. <br>
SPOCK: That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of
your beads and rattles.

SULU: I can't, sir. All the controls are jammed. <br>
KIRK: Spock, take over. <br>
NORMAN: It will not be necessary, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me
what this is all about, mister? <br>
NORMAN: I am in total control of your ship. I have connected the
matter-antimatter pods to the main navigational bank. A trigger relay
is now in operation. Any attempts to alter course will result in
immediate destruction of this vessel. <br>
KIRK: Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If
we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is,
we could extinguish ourselves. <br>
KIRK: Who are you? <br>
NORMAN: I assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life. We
mean you no harm, but we require your ship. <br>
KIRK: You require? Who and what are we? <br>
(Norman lifts his tunic and opens a panel in his abdomen. There are
circuit boards, wires and the obligatory flashing lights in there.) <br>
KIRK: An android. <br>
SPOCK: And most sophisticated. <br>
NORMAN: I control the trigger relay, sir. I cannot be overcome by
physical means, and if you attempt to use your phasers, the trigger
relay will be activated. We shall continue on our present course for
approximately four solar days, at which time we shall arrive at our
destination. <br>
KIRK: Who sent you? <br>
NORMAN: I am not programmed to respond in that area. <br>
SPOCK: (attempting a mind meld) He simply appears to have turned
himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done
without destroying the ship <br>
KIRK: It seems we're going to take a little trip.

NORMAN: If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and
you will remain in orbit here forever. <br>
KIRK: I must say that's a gracious invitation. <br>
NORMAN: There is a word. Among us there is no corresponding meaning,
but it seems to mean something to you humans. <br>

MUDD: Welcome aboard, Kirk. It's been a long time, eh? <br>
KIRK: Harry Mudd. <br>
MUDD: Well, to be absolutely accurate, laddybuck, you should refer to
me as Mudd the First, ruler of this entire sovereign planet. <br>
KIRK: Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We
have no intention of staying as your guests. <br>
MUDD: Well, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem there.<br>

MUDD: Alice. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
(Alice reaches out and crushes the communicator.) <br>
MUDD: Now, now, now, now, Jamie boy, let's have no unauthorised
communications. <br>
CHEKOV: You know this man, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief <br>
MUDD: Come now. <br>
KIRK: Swindler and con man <br>
MUDD: Entrepreneur. <br>
KIRK: Liar and rogue. <br>
MUDD: Did I leave you with that impression? <br>
KIRK: He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd. <br>
MUDD: And thereby hangs a tale, yes. But look around you, Kirk. Quite a
place, isn't it? I hope you're all going to enjoy it. <br>
KIRK: Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate
the trigger mechanism and free my ship. <br>
MUDD: I shall do that, Kirk, when I'm ready. <br>
KIRK: I'm telling you now. <br>
MUDD: And I do the telling on this planet, Kirk, old boy. You do the
listening. <br>
KIRK: All right, I'll listen. What are you telling? <br>
MUDD: Merely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves. It's
really a very, very nice place, and you're all going to be here
quite probably for the rest of your lives. (laughs) <br>
KIRK: Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I
want navigational control restored, my ship released. <br>
MUDD: Sorry. That'd be against the law. My law. Decreed by Mudd the
First. Voted in by the resident population. Lovely, aren't they? You
must admit, Kirk, that I still retain my eye for beauty. I decreed that
I should always be surrounded by it, and my decrees always come to
pass. I've had five hundred of them made up to attend me. All of them
identical, beautiful, compliant, obedient. <br>
SPOCK: Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant. <br>
MUDD: I have a fondness for this particular model, Mister Spock, which
you, unfortunately, are ill-equipped to appreciate. <br>
KIRK: All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in
custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet. <br>
MUDD: Yes, well, I organised a technical information service bringing
modern industrial techniques to backward planets, making available
certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout
the galaxy. <br>
KIRK: Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents? <br>
MUDD: Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free enterprise
system, I found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict
as a matter of principle. <br>
SPOCK: He did not pay royalties. <br>
MUDD: Knowledge, sir, should be free to all. <br>
KIRK: Who caught you? <br>
MUDD: That, sir, is an outrageous assumption. <br>
KIRK: Yes. Who caught you? <br>
MUDD: I sold the Denebians all the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesiser.
<br>
KIRK: And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans. <br>
MUDD: How'd you know? <br>
KIRK: That's what I would have done. <br>
MUDD: It's typical police mentality. They've got no sense of humour.
They arrested me. <br>
MCCOY: Oh, I find that shocking. <br>
MUDD: Worse than that. Do know what the penalty for fraud is on Deneb
Five? <br>
SPOCK: The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death
by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging. <br>
MUDD: The key word in your entire peroration, Mister Spock, was, death.
Barbarians. Well, of course, I left. <br>
KIRK: He broke jail. <br>
MUDD: I borrowed transportation. <br>
KIRK: He stole a spaceship. <br>
MUDD: The patrol reacted in a hostile manner. <br>
KIRK: They fired at him. <br>
MUDD: They've no respect for private property. They damaged the bloody
spaceship. Well, I got away, but I couldn't navigate, so I wandered out
through unmapped space, and here I found Mudd. <br>
SPOCK: You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship
here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive. <br>
MUDD: Spock, you're going to love it here. They all talk just the way
you do. <br>
KIRK: Go on, get on with it, Harry. <br>
MUDD: Yes, well, right, laddybuck. So here I am in a planet with over
two hundred thousand hard-working, happy androids, all of whom exist
merely to serve my every whim. It's absolute paradise. <br>
SPOCK: Then I'm unable to discern your problem. <br>
MUDD: They won't let me go. They want to study me. They want to learn
more about human beings. <br>
KIRK: They picked a fine representative. <br>
MUDD: Watch your tongue, lad. You're talking about Mudd the First.
Well, anyway, I ran out of ideas. I simply ran out of things for them
to do, and they insisted that I bring them more human beings. They need
human beings to serve, to study. So I had to promise them a prime
sample. A starship captain. Bright, loyal, fearless and imaginative.
Any captain would have done. I was lucky to get you. So you are going
to take over for me here, and I can get off this rock and back to
civilisation. <br>
KIRK: I think not, Harry. <br>
MUDD: You misunderstand me, lad. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
You've no choice. Show them to their quarters. <br>
NORMAN and ALICES: Yes, my Lord Mudd. <br>
ALICE: This way, please. <br>
MCCOY: (noticing a curtained alcove) Harry, what's this? <br>
MUDD: Ah. That, gentlemen, is a shrine to the memory of my beloved
Stella. <br>
KIRK: Who? <br>
MUDD: Stella, my wife. <br>
(Revealing a woman of sour features.) <br>
MCCOY: Dead? <br>
MUDD: Oh, no, no, no. Merely deserted. You see, gentlemen, behind every
great man there is a woman urging him on. And so it was with my Stella.
She urged me on into outer space. Not that she meant to, but with her
continual, eternal, confounded nagging. Well, I think of her
constantly, and every time I do, I go further out into space. <br>
MCCOY: That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her
along. <br>
MUDD: I had the androids construct a perfect replica of Stella so that
I could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence. Gentlemen, attend.
Stella, dear. <br>
STELLA: Harcourt. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, what have you been up to?
Nothing good, I'm sure. Well, let me tell you, you lazy,
good-for-nothing <br>
MUDD: Shut up. <br>
STELLA: Nothing, thing, thing, <br>
MUDD: Marvellous, isn't it? I finally have the last word with her, and
with you. </font></p>

NORMAN: The makers designed us. They came from the galaxy of Andromeda.
<br>
MCCOY: Then your makers weren't humanoid? <br>
NORMAN: They were, as you say, quite humanoid, but, unlike your
civilisation, robots were common. We performed the necessary service
functions and freed our makers to evolve a perfect social order. <br>
KIRK: What became of them? <br>
NORMAN: Our home planet's sun became a nova. Only a few exploratory
outposts survived. This unit, myself, was part of one such outpost in
your galaxy. <br>
KIRK: Then some of your makers survive. <br>
NORMAN: No, Captain. They died over the stretch of time. <br>

ALICE 2: Our research laboratories and workshops are extremely well
equipped. <br>
BOTH: You are free to visit them. <br>
KIRK: All right. We might later. In the meantime, would you mind
leaving us? <br>

KIRK: Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble. <br>
SPOCK: We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the
matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently.
There must be a central control system which guides the entire android
population. <br>

you can. I'll see what else I can find out from Mister Mudd. Let's go. </font></p>

beam down an entire crew of a spaceship. Somebody has to be on board. <br>

learn very quickly, Captain. The fact is, I've taken over your whole

SPOCK: He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a
number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd.
Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can
literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited
quantity. <br>

ALICE 118: You desire something else, lord? <br>
CHEKOV: What a shame you're not real. <br>
ALICE 322: We are real, my lord. <br>
CHEKOV: Oh, I mean real girls. <br>
ALICE 118: We are programmed to function as human females, lord. <br>
CHEKOV: You are? <br>
ALICES: Yes, my lord. <br>
CHEKOV: Harry Mudd programmed you? <br>
ALICES: Yes, my lord. <br>
CHEKOV: That unprincipled, evil-minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd
programmed you? <br>
ALICES: Yes, my lord. <br>
CHEKOV: This place is even better than Leningrad.

microvision, and a nanopulse laser. I've never seen the like before. <br>
NORMAN: You may command us to make anything for you, or do the work
yourself for pleasure. You may have the services of any number of

(Mudd and Kirk enter.) <br>
SCOTT: Captain, you should see this shop! Why, they have facilities

KIRK: Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at
their weakest point? <br>

SCOTT: What did they offer you, Uhura? <br>
UHURA: Oh, nothing really important. Just immortality. <br>
KIRK: All right. We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget
it. Straighten up! This may be a gilded cage filled with everything you
always wanted, but it's still a cage. We don't belong here. We belong
on that ship up there. <br>
ALICE 471: Do you require something, lord? <br>
KIRK: No. Yes. My ship. <br>
ALICE 471: I am not programmed <br>
ALICE and KIRK: To respond in that area. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I know. <br>
ALICE 471: Is there anything any of you require to please you? <br>
KIRK: Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship

ALICE 471: We are programmed to serve. We shall serve you to your best
interests to make you happy. <br>
KIRK: But we're unhappy here. <br>
ALICE 471: Please explain unhappy. <br>
SPOCK: Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants
and desires are not fulfilled. <br>
ALICE 471: Which wants and desires of yours are not fulfilled? <br>
KIRK: We want the Enterprise. <br>
(Alice's label flashes.) <br>
ALICE 471: The Enterprise is not a want or a desire. It is a mechanical
device. <br>
KIRK: No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her. <br>
ALICE 471: Illogical. Illogical. All units relate. All units. Norman,
co-ordinate. Unhappiness does not relate. We must study this. <br>
(She leaves.) <br>
KIRK: Interesting. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of
the androids? <br>
MCCOY: I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless,
mentally and physically. No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined.
No vices, no fears, no faults. Just a sense of purpose. Believe me,
there's nothing tougher to overcome, even among humans. <br>
KIRK: Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you. <br>
MUDD: Afraid I won't have time to answer them. My bags are all packed.
The androids will take the Enterprise out of orbit in less than twenty
four hours. But it's been a real pleasure having you here, Kirk. Is
there anything I can get for you? <br>
KIRK: Yes. My ship. <br>
MUDD: You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you? But I don't mind. I don't
mind that at all. Because I'll be leaving here quickly enough, and then
you can be stubborn at your own leisure. One last time. Stella, dear. <br>
STELLA: Harcourt Fenton Mudd, where have you been? What have you been
up to? Have you been drinking again, you miserable sot!
You good-for-nothing <br>
MUDD: Shut up! <br>
STELLA: Thing, thing, thing. <br>
MUDD: Alice Number 2, my little love. Will you have my bags transported
up to the ship? <br>
ANDROIDS: No, my Lord Mudd.<br>
MUDD: What? <br>
NORMAN: We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd. <br>
MUDD: Why not? <br>
NORMAN: Our makers were wise. They programmed us to serve. <br>
MUDD: Yes, but that's what I'm saying. Put my bags on the ship. <br>
KIRK: Harry, I think they have something else in mind. <br>
NORMAN: You are correct, Captain. Harry Mudd is flawed, even for a
human being. We recognised this from the beginning but used his
knowledge to obtain more specimens. Your species is self-destructive.
You need our help. <br>
KIRK: We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human.
And maybe that's the word that best explains us. <br>
NORMAN: We will not harm you, but we will take the starship, and you
will remain on this planet. <br>
MUDD: Now, look here. You can't do that! Now, listen. To serve us, you
must obey us. <br>
ANDROIDS: No, my Lord Mudd. <br>
MUDD: Alice number One, obey me. Put my bags on that ship! <br>
(She gives him a gentle push and he goes reeling backwards until he
falls.) <br>
NORMAN: We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to
have free run of the galaxy. <br>
SPOCK: I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them? <br>
NORMAN: We shall serve them. Their kind will be eager to accept our
service. Soon they will become completely dependent upon us. <br>
ALICE 99: Their aggressive and acquisitive instincts will be under our
control. <br>
NORMAN: We shall take care of them. <br>
SPOCK: Eminently practical. <br>
KIRK: The whole galaxy controlled by your kind? <br>
NORMAN: Yes, Captain. And we shall serve them and you will be happy,
and controlled. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: So far this thing has had its amusing
aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the
humans in the galaxy is not very funny. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish
it. <br>
MUDD: Take my word for it, they can. <br>
SPOCK: Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They
have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and
they'll be able to leave orbit. <br>
MCCOY: How do you know so much? <br>
SPOCK: I asked them. <br>
MCCOY: Oh. <br>
KIRK: Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can
do anything to stop them. <br>
MUDD: You're so smart, Kirk, you and this pointy-eared thinking machine
of yours. Well, you'd better do something because I'm as anxious to get
off this ruddy rock as you are. <br>
MCCOY: You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.
<br>
MUDD: Oh, yes. <br>
KIRK: All right, what have we got to work with? <br>
SCOTT: Well, Captain, androids and robots, they're just not capable of
independent, creative thought. <br>
SPOCK: Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is
totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred
thousand of them. <br>
KIRK: I agree. What in your opinion does direct them? <br>
SPOCK: There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies,
Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar
series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman. <br>
KIRK: Norman. When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a
lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate. Why
Norman? Unless <br>
SPOCK: To function as they do, each android mind must be one component
of a mass brain linked through a central locus. <br>
KIRK: Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And
the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation. <br>
SPOCK: That would seem logical. <br>
KIRK: Yes, logical. That's what it is. And that in turn gives us a
weapon that we can use against them. We must use wild, insane,
irrational illogic aimed right at Norman! <br>
MUDD: Captain, you sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen, but
what the devil are you talking about? <br>
SPOCK: What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only,
opportunity. <br>
MUDD: Opportunity? Now, listen, Spock, you may be a wonderful science
officer, but believe me, you couldn't sell fake patents to your mother.
<br>
SPOCK: I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to
purchase falsified patents. <br>
MUDD: Forget it. <br>
KIRK: Let's get to the point. Harry, you said you wanted to help. Do
you? <br>
MUDD: Captain, the kind of a wholesome, antiseptic galaxy that these
androids would run would be purgatory for a man like me. <br>
KIRK: That's fine, Harry. The androids will be expecting us to make a
break for it, and that's where you come in. <br>
MUDD: What can I do? <br>
KIRK: Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep. <br>
MUDD: What do you mean? (McCoy produces a hypo) Oh, now, now wait a
minute, gentlemen. No, what I, I, (gets injected) had in mind was
actually more in the line of a few words of sage counsel as it were.

SCOTT: Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens. <br>
BOTH: Only this way can we be happy. <br>

happier he's dead, and we'll miss him. Let us hear it for our poor,
dead friend. <br>

that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised
but only dreamed! The highest reality. <br>

NORMAN: That is irrational. Illogical. Dreams are not real. <br>

Spock, it is time. The explosive. <br>

(He removes an invisible package from under his tunic.) <br>
SCOTT: Explosive! (gets up again) <br>
MUDD: Don't panic. Women and children first. <br>
Mister Spock, isn't that too much for our purposes? <br>
SPOCK: I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are
you ready? <br>
MUDD: Aye, aye! (adopts a catchers pose) <br>

Everything Harry tells you is a lie. <br>
MUDD: Listen to this carefully, Norman. I am lying. <br>
NORMAN: You say you are lying, but if everything you say is a lie then
you are telling the truth, but you cannot tell the truth because
everything you say is a lie. You lie. You tell the truth. But you
cannot for. Illogical! Illogical! Please explain. <br>

unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy? <br>
MCCOY: Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours.
Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic. And we poor, irrational

to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.
<br>
MUDD: But what do I do? Kirk, I'm no scientist. <br>
KIRK: No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a
first-class example to the androids of a human failure. They'll learn
by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future. <br>
MUDD: How long? <br>
KIRK: As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry. It's up to you.
<br>
MUDD: I suppose that taking everything into consideration, as it were,
and noting all the different possibilities,
I could manage. And as detention sentences go, this one isn't too
uncomfortable. And I'm back in the galaxy again! <br>

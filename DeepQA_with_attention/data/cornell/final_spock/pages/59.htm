Enterprise Medical Log, stardate 5027.3. Doctor Leonard McCoy
recording. I'm concerned about Captain Kirk. He shows indications of
increasing tension and emotional stress.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHEKOV: I have completed the assignment, Captain. A
theoretical incursion into <br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Chekov. I can read, and as usual your theoretical
evaluations do not tally with mine. Return to your duty and I'll let
you know when your work is satisfactory. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. Full sensor scan of the region, please. <br>
SPOCK: I did give a full report <br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, that was the past. I'm concerned with the
present. Or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current
information? <br>
SPOCK; No, sir. Compliance presents no problem. <br>
KIRK: Then, Mister Spock, comply. <br>
SPOCK: Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Very well. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: I can find no reason for the captain's behaviour, except
possibly that we've been on patrol too long without relief and
diversion. He has resisted all of my attempts to run a psychological
profile on him. <br>
SULU: Maintaining course and speed, sir. <br>
KIRK: Change course. Come about to one eight five, mark three. <br>
SULU: But, sir, that'll lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone.
<br>
KIRK: Yes, very perceptive, Mister Sulu. I know where the course change
takes us. Execute. <br>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear.
Nothing in our immediate vicinity. <br>
KIRK: Better and better, Mister Spock. <br>
SULU: Captain, leaving Neutral Zone. Now entering Romulan space. <br>
(Scott enters the Bridge.) <br>
KIRK: Very well, Mister Sulu. <br>
SCOTT: Lieutenant, when did the order come through? <br>
UHURA: Order? <br>
SCOTT: From Starfleet. The order to enter the Neutral Zone. <br>
UHURA: There's been no order I know of, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Surely the Captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority. <br>
KIRK: If you two have complaints, you can bring them out into the open.
<br>
(A sinister shape appears on the viewscreen.) <br>
SCOTT: That's a Klingon ship! But it couldn't be, not in this area. <br>
SPOCK: Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design. <br>
KIRK: Sound Red Alert. Man battle stations. Stand by main phasers. <br>
UHURA: Battle stations. All hands, battle stations. <br>
SPOCK: A second ship has appeared. (another one decloaks) Correction,
there are now three. We are surrounded. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command. Advise
them of our situation. Include all log entries to this point. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened? <br>
SPOCK: I have a theory, Captain. <br>
UHURA: Captain Kirk, I'm receiving a class two signal from the Romulan
vessel. <br>
KIRK: Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that
message to Starfleet Command. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
TAL [on viewscreen]: (a thin male) You have been identified as the star
ship Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk last known to be in command. <br>
KIRK: Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. <br>
TAL [on viewscreen]: I am Sub-commander Tal of the Romulan fleet. Your
ship is surrounded, Captain. You will surrender immediately, or we will
destroy you. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. (mutes sound) They want something, or they would have
destroyed us by now. <br>
SPOCK: True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure. <br>
KIRK: It's my ship they want, and very badly. <br>
SPOCK: It would be a great prize. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. (sound on) Save your threats. If you board this ship,
I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing. <br>
TAL [on viewscreen]: Who is that beside you? <br>
KIRK: My first officer, Commander Spock. <br>
TAL [on viewscreen]: Vulcan. (his communicator beeps and he answers it)
Yes, Commander. Yes, Commander. No one should decide quickly to die,
Captain. We give you one of your hours. If you do not surrender your
ship
at the end of that time, your destruction is certain. We will be open
to communication should you wish it. <br>
KIRK: You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the
situation? <br>
TAL [on viewscreen]: The subspace message will take three weeks to
reach Starfleet. The decision is yours, Captain. One hour. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Briefing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: The design of the ship is the same. Mister
Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the
new ships until they were upon us. <br>
SPOCK: I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which
renders our tracking sensors useless. <br>
KIRK: If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we
knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to
get their defences up. <br>
SCOTT: They caught us right enough. <br>
KIRK: Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott. Do you have
any other helpful opinions? <br>
SCOTT: We've not got many choices. <br>
KIRK: We have three. We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy
the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans.
Or we can surrender. Opinions, gentlemen. <br>
SCOTT: If the Enterprise is taken by Romulans, they'll know everything
there is to know about a starship. <br>
SPOCK: If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would
not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have
had to be made. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, you ordered us? You had no authority! <br>
KIRK: Dismissed, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Jim! <br>
KIRK: I said dismissed. <br>
(McCoy leaves.) <br>
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA: The Romulan vessel is signalling again, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Briefing room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Put them on the screen. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
TAL [on monitor]: My commander wishes to speak with you, Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Put him on. <br>
TAL [on monitor]: The commander wishes to see you and your first
officer aboard this vessel. It is felt this matter requires discussion.
<br>
KIRK: Why should we walk right into your hands? <br>
TAL [on monitor]: Two of my officers will beam aboard your vessel as
exchange hostages while you are here. <br>
KIRK: What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're
on yours? <br>
TAL [on monitor]: Granted, we do not easily trust each other, Captain,
but you are the ones who violated our territory. Should it not be we
who distrust your motives? However, we agree to simultaneous exchange. <br>
KIRK: Give us your transporter co-ordinates. We're beaming aboard. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Transporter room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: One final order, Engineer Scott. If we do not
return, the Enterprise must not be taken. If the Romulans attempt it,
you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves. Is that clear? <br>
SCOTT: Perfectly clear. <br>
KIRK: Energise. <br>
(As Kirk and Spock beam out, two Romulans beam in. Once solid, they
draw their weapons. Scott scowls.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Romulan Commander's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The figure in the curved chair swivels round to
reveal that the Commander is a
woman in a uniform that barely covers her bottom, and thigh-length
boots held up
by suspender belt.) <br>
COMMANDER: Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Commander. I'm honoured. <br>
COMMANDER: I don't think so, but we have an important matter to
discuss. And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that
discussion. You are the first officer? <br>
SPOCK: Spock. <br>
COMMANDER: I speak first with the Captain. You may wait outside. <br>
(Spock and the two guards leave) <br>
COMMANDER: The matter of trespass into Romulan space is one of galactic
import, a violation of treaties. Now I ask you simply, what is your
mission here? <br>
KIRK: Instrument failure caused navigational error. We were across the
Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your
ships before we could get back. <br>
COMMANDER: A starship? One of the Starfleet's finest vessels? You're
saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed
until you were well past the Neutral Zone? <br>
KIRK: Accidents happen. Cut off back-up systems malfunction. We were
due for overhaul two months ago. <br>
COMMANDER: I see. But you were able to navigate with this malfunction? <br>
KIRK: The error was corrected. <br>
COMMANDER: But I doubt it'll clear you of espionage. <br>
KIRK: We were not spying, Commander. <br>
COMMANDER: Your language has always been most difficult for me,
Captain. Perhaps you have another word for it. <br>
KIRK: You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there <br>
COMMANDER: Captain, if a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation
territory without good explanation, what would a starbase commander do?
You see, it works both ways. I hardly believe you are the injured
party. Spock, come in. <br>
(Spock and the guards enter.) <br>
COMMANDER: The captain has made his statement. <br>
SPOCK: I understand. <br>
COMMANDER: I must admit some surprise on seeing you, Spock. We were not
aware of Vulcans aboard the Enterprise. <br>
SPOCK: Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its
ships' personnel. <br>
COMMANDER: Quite so. Yet there are certain ships, certain officers,
that are known to us. Your situation appears most interesting. <br>
KIRK: What earns Spock your special interest? <br>
COMMANDER: He is a Vulcan. Our forebears had the same roots and
origins. Something you wouldn't understand, Captain. We can appreciate
the Vulcans, our distant brothers. I have heard of Vulcan integrity and
personal honour. There's a well-known saying, or is it a myth, that
Vulcans are incapable of lying? <br>
SPOCK: It is no myth. <br>
COMMANDER: Then tell me truthfully now, by your honour as a Vulcan,
what was your mission? <br>
SPOCK: I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not
violate my honour as a Vulcan. <br>
COMMANDER: It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge. <br>
SPOCK: You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan.
It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself. <br>
COMMANDER: Then there is a truth here that remains unspoken. <br>
KIRK: You've been told everything. There's nothing else to say. <br>
COMMANDER: There is Mister Spock's unspoken truth. You knew of the
cloaking device that we have developed. You deliberately violated
Romulan space with a blatant spy mission, by order of the Federation. <br>
KIRK: We've been all through that, Commander! <br>
COMMANDER: We have not even begun! There's no force that I can use on a
Vulcan that will make him speak. That is a fact. But there are Romulan
methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses. <br>
SPOCK: You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove
ineffective against the captain. <br>
COMMANDER: Then they will leave him dead, or what might be worse than
dead. But I will know your unspoken truths. <br>
KIRK: Let her rant. There's nothing to say. <br>
SPOCK: I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain
of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several
weeks. <br>
KIRK: That's a lie! <br>
SPOCK: As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional
person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision. <br>
KIRK: Shut up, Spock! <br>
SPOCK: I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that
Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable.
Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness. <br>
KIRK: You filthy liar! <br>
SPOCK: I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and
the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered
the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his
craving for glory. <br>
KIRK: (having to be held back by the guards) I'll kill you, you filthy
traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! <br>
SPOCK: He is not sane. <br>
COMMANDER: (into comm. system) Attention, Enterprise, I am speaking to
you from the Romulan flagship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COMMANDER [OC]: Spock was highly instrumental in

along with as many of you as we can take with us. <br>
COMMANDER: You humans make a brave noise. There are ways to convince
you of your errors. <br>
KIRK: Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of
value you ever knew. Did you hear the sound of human integrity? <br>
COMMANDER: Take him to the security room. <br>
(Kirk is dragged out, struggling.) <br>
COMMANDER: A Vulcan among humans. Living, working with them. I would
think the situation would be intolerable to you. <br>
SPOCK: I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human. <br>
COMMANDER: To whom is your allegiance then? Do you call yourself Terran
or Vulcan? <br>
SPOCK: Vulcan. <br>
COMMANDER: How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Eighteen years. <br>
COMMANDER: And you serve Captain Kirk. Do you like him? Do you like
your shipmates? <br>
SPOCK: The question is irrelevant. <br>
COMMANDER: Possibly, but you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders,
even to his whims. <br>
SPOCK: My duty as an officer is to obey him. <br>
COMMANDER: You are a superior being. Why do you not command? <br>
SPOCK: I do not desire a ship of my own. <br>
COMMANDER: Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that
opportunity? <br>
SPOCK: Such opportunities are extremely rare. <br>
COMMANDER: For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments,
opportunities are made and will be. I will see to that, if you'll stop
looking on the Federation as the whole universe. It is not, you know. <br>
SPOCK: That thought has occasionally crossed my mind. <br>
COMMANDER: You must have your own ship. <br>
SPOCK: Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately
need a ship. You want the Enterprise. <br>
COMMANDER: Of course. It would be a great achievement for me to bring
home the Enterprise intact. It would broaden the scope of my powers
greatly. It would be the achievement of a lifetime. And it would open
equal opportunities for you. <br>

pain-giving properties of the force-field across the doorway.)

incapacity have afflicted him earlier? <br>

to the mental state of your captain. He was and is unfit to continue in

would make him sell out. <br>

MCCOY: What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion? <br>
COMMANDER: That's enough, Doctor. As a physician, your duty is to save
lives. Mister Spock's duty is to lead the Enterprise and its crew to a
safe haven. <br>

the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further. <br>

SPOCK: A place? <br>
COMMANDER: With me. Romulan women are not like Vulcan females. We are
not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion. Our
people are warriors. Often savage. But we are also many other pleasant
things. <br>

ways to appreciate it. <br>
SPOCK: Please believe me. I do appreciate it. <br>
COMMANDER: I am so glad. Now one final step to make the occasion
complete. You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the
Enterprise, and there you will take your rightful place as its
commander. And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port, with my
flagship at its side. <br>

do even better. Would it not, Commander? <br>

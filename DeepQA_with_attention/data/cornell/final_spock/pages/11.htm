schizophrenia, tissue damage, or any condition I'm acquainted with,
Jim. And you know after getting him here, it took almost a triple dose
of sedative to put him under.<br>
KIRK: Your report said he was quite talkative.<br>
MCCOY: But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed
to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with
just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim.<br>
KIRK: Not our problem, Bones.<br>
GELDER: You smart, button-pushing brass hat. Wash your hands of it. Is
that your system? You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you?
Quite expert. Take him back. Let someone else worry about him.<br>
KIRK: What did you say your name was?<br>
GELDER: My name? My name is Simon Van Gelder. (in great pain) I was the
director of, director at the Tantalus colony.<br>

knew, but they've erased it.<br>

GELDER: Edited, adjusted, subverted me, but I won't forget! I won't
forget! You, you're so blind ignorant. You believe I belong back there,
don't you? Dead or alive. Well, I won't let you take me back. I'm not

ADAMS [OC]: Captain Kirk, Doctor Adams here.<br>
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man<br>
ADAMS [OC]: Is Doctor Van Gelder all right? And your people, no
injuries?<br>
KIRK: No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?<br>
ADAMS [OC]: Yes, of course. You're certain he's all right? We've been
very concerned. In the violent state he's in<br>
KIRK: No harm to him, sir. We thought you might enlighten us as to his
condition.<br>
ADAMS [OC]: He'd been doing some experimental work, Captain, an
experimental beam we'd hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles. Van
Gelder felt he hadn't the moral right to expose another man to
something he hadn't tried on his own person.<br>
KIRK: Tragedy, Doctor.<br>
MCCOY: Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.<br>
KIRK: Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.<br>
MCCOY: I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study
that patient<br>
KIRK: You don't believe him, and you can't explain it. Bones, are you
aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to
revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than
all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries? I've been to
those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and
they're not cages anymore.<br>
MCCOY: Jim<br>
KIRK: They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds.<br>
MCCOY: Jim, listen!<br>
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder
returned.<br>
KIRK: Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder.<br>
ADAMS [OC]: Yes, Captain. May I inquire about your patrol destinations?
Are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours? I'd like
Van Gelder to have the best possible treatment, of course.<br>
KIRK: Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand
by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better
place?<br>
MCCOY: There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not
the question. If something unusual is going on down there<br>
KIRK: An assumption, Doctor.<br>
MCCOY: I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log.
That requires you to answer in your log. Sorry, Jim.<br>
KIRK: Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict
interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an
investigation of this so that a proper report<br>
ADAMS [OC]: No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as
a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm
sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er,
Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum
staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible.<br>
KIRK: Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before.

great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what

ADAMS: Ah, Lethe, come in. Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen
Noel. Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist,
and a very good one too, I might add.<br>

LETHE: I was another person, malignant, hateful.<br>
KIRK: May I ask what crime you committed?<br>
LETHE: Does it matter? That person no longer exists.<br>
ADAMS: Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past.
Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no
necess. Oh, I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that,
Doctor. Helen.<br>
NOEL: A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.<br>
ADAMS: Yes. And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe. There
you are, Captain. To all mankind. May we never find space so vast,
planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that, that we cannot fill them
with love and warmth.

like to talk about their personal failures, you know? It was just an
experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid.<br>

scientific fact<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADAMS: A neural neutraliser. Experimental.
Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all. That beam
from above neutralises brain waves, relaxes the patient's mind. Does
them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary.<br>
KIRK: One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good <br>
ADAMS: Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's
always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more
violent cases. <br>
NOEL: Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump
chemicals into a person's bloodstream <br>
ADAMS: Exactly my point, Helen. Yes. Shall we? (he and Noel leave) <br>
KIRK: (to therapist) How does it work? <br>
THERAPIST: Quite simple. Off on switches, and the large control here
changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam.<br>
ADAMS: Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of
the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on
one foot.<br>
NOEL: Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain.
I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can
assure you that Doctor Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here.<br>
KIRK: I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir,
was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred.<br>
ADAMS: Right here, Captain. Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man. He
could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or
even higher. Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in
case he got into trouble, but, but no. He tried it alone and on full
volume. It's a pity.<br>
KIRK: (to therapist) Thank you. (leaves) <br>

Adams<br>
KIRK: I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're
somewhat familiar with the theory behind it? <br>
NOEL: Yes, somewhat, but if you'd simply state any doubts you have to
Doctor Adams<br>
KIRK: And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a
thing. The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work, or is
that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well?<br>
NOEL: Coming.

GELDER: We are Simon Van Gelder.<br>
SPOCK: Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?<br>
GELDER: He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase our
memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much
power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so
blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts.
Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty.
Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from
him. Love.<br>
SPOCK: Yes.<br>
GELDER: Hate.<br>
SPOCK: Yes.<br>
GELDER: Live.<br>
SPOCK: Yes.<br>
GELDER: Die.<br>
SPOCK: Yes.<br>
GELDER: Such agony to be empty.<br>

be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?<br>
NOEL: Yes.<br>
KIRK: And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in
the slightest?<br>
NOEL: Yes, Captain. I know my profession. (Kirk sits in treatment
chair) Ready?<br>
KIRK: Mm-hmm.<br>
NOEL: We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two. (light turns) <br>
KIRK: Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.<br>
NOEL: We already tried it for that long, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Nothing happened. <br>
NOEL: Something happened. Your face went completely blank.<br>
KIRK: Try a harmless suggestion.<br>
NOEL: (light turns) You're hungry.<br>
KIRK: You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and
raid a kitchen somewhere.<br>
NOEL: I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain. I said simply that
you were hungry.<br>
KIRK: Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to
abandon.<br>
NOEL: I think we should try this again.<br>
KIRK: Yes. Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we
can both be sure of.<br>
NOEL: (light turns) At the Christmas party, we met, we danced, you
talked about the stars. I suggest now that it happened in a different
way. You swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin.

KIRK: My crew is sworn to secrecy.<br>
NOEL: But my reputation. I mean, just having met like this. Of course,
it would be different if you cared for me.<br>

demonstration. I want there to be no doubts whatsoever in his mind.
Mmm. You're madly in love with Helen, Captain. You'd lie, cheat, steal
for her, sacrifice your career, your reputation.<br>
NOEL: No, Doctor! No! <br>
ADAMS: The pain. Do you feel it, Captain? You must have her, or the
pain grows worse, the pain, the longing for her.<br>

NOEL: No. <br>
ADAMS: For years, you've loved her, Captain, for years.<br>
KIRK: For years, I've loved you. <br>
ADAMS: You must continue to remember that, Captain. And now, she's
gone. (machine to maximum) <br>
KIRK: Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen! <br>
ADAMS: (reduces intensity) Now Captain, you must take your phaser
weapon and drop it on the floor. Captain, the pain increases unless you
obey me.<br>
KIRK: I must drop it.<br>
ADAMS: Very good, Captain. Very good indeed. And now your communicator.
Drop it on the floor. <br>

NOEL: Remember. Doctor Adams took the controls away from me. Do you
remember the pain and then his voice? Remember?<br>
KIRK: Yes. Yes, I remember. I remember. Helen. Look. The duct. The
duct. Give me a hand here. Pull. (cover comes open) Air conditioning.
It has to connect with other ducts and tunnels. You can get through
this. It might lead to the power supply. Short-circuited, it would cut
off the security force field. Have you had any training in hyper-power
circuits?<br>
NOEL: No.<br>

ADAMS: Excellent, Captain. I compliment you. Do you know Doctor Van
Gelder was down on his hands and knees sobbing at this point? It was so

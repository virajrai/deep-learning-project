and terrain are undisturbed. No evidence of a colony nor any residual
aftereffect of a force that might have annihilated it. <br>
KIRK: Life readings, Doctor McCoy? <br>
MCCOY: Nothing. They said they were being attacked by an unidentified

CHEKOV: Which we were unable to detect upon approach. <br>

(The Klingons arrive, and their leader hits Kirk with his disruptor,
knocking him down.) <br>
KANG: You attacked my ship! Four hundred of my crew dead. Kirk, my ship
is disabled. I claim yours. You are now prisoners of the Klingon Empire
against which you have committed a wanton act of war! <br>
(And a weird swirl of light hangs in the air a little way away. The
Federation landing party are disarmed.) <br>
KANG: For three years, the Federation and the Klingon Empire have been
at peace. A treaty we have honoured to the letter. <br>
KIRK: We took no action against your ship, Kang. <br>
KANG: Were the screams of my crew imaginary? What were your orders,
Kirk? To start a war? You've succeeded. To test a new weapon? We shall
be happy to examine it. <br>
KIRK: There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed. <br>
KANG: By what? No bodies, no ruins. A colony of the invisible? <br>
KIRK: Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces.
Federation ships don't specialise in sneak attacks. <br>
KANG: We have wondered when you would begin. You lured my ship into
ambush by a false Klingon distress call. You will tell us why with the
proper persuasion. <br>
KIRK: You received a distress call? We received a distress call. <br>
KANG: I don't propose to spend the rest of my life on this ball of dust
arguing your fantasies. The Enterprise is mine!
Instruct your transporter room to beam us aboard. <br>
KIRK: Go to the devil. <br>
KANG: We have no devil, Kirk. But we understand the habits of yours. I
shall torture you to death one by one until your noble captain cries
enough. Who will be first? <br>
CHEKOV: Cossacks! Filthy Klingon murderers! You killed my brother
Piotre. The Archanis Four research outpost. A hundred peaceful people
massacred! Just like you did here. My brother, you killed my brother. <br>
KANG: And you volunteer to join him. That is loyalty. <br>
(A Klingon places an agoniser on Chekov's face, and he screams. Kirk is
held back.) <br>
KIRK: Chekov! Stop the torture! <br>
MCCOY: Jim, you can't hand over the Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: Help Chekov. <br>
KANG: Don't plan any tricks, Kirk. I will kill one hundred hostages at
the first sign of treachery. <br>
KIRK: I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise. Once there, no tricks. <br>
(Kang gives him a communicator.) <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, you can't. Don't let these animals have the ship. <br>
MCCOY: Move aside. (he tends to Chekov) <br>
KANG: Animals? Your captain crawls like one. A Klingon would never have
surrendered. Order everybody in this area to be transported up. All
weapons on him. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Here, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, we have guests. Adjust transporter to wide field.
Beam up everyone in the target area. (and presses a button) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Just the four Federation people materialise on the

KIRK: Full security, Johnson, on the double. <br>
(The security guard runs off, Spock enters.) <br>
KIRK: Good work, Spock. <br>
MCCOY: What happened? <br>
SPOCK: Our landing party is intact, Doctor. <br>
SCOTT: All others suspended in transit. Who are the guests, by the way?
<br>
KIRK: Klingons. <br>
SCOTT: Well, they're right in here. <br>
KIRK: Johnson? <br>
JOHNSON: Security on the way, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, leave them where they are. Non-existence. That's so
many less Klingon monsters in the galaxy. <br>
(Two more security guards arrive.) <br>
KIRK: Bring them in. <br>
(The Klingons materialise, and are quickly disarmed.) <br>
JOHNSON: Move 'em out. Move! <br>
KANG: Liar! <br>
KIRK: I said no tricks after we reach the ship. You're a prisoner of
the Federation of Planets against which you may or may not have
committed an act of war. <br>
KANG: There are still survivors aboard my ship.
<br>SCOTT: Captain, we've not been able to get through to Starfleet
Command. All subspace frequencies have been blocked, and there's too
much radiation coming from that Klingon ship. It's a hazard to the
vicinity. <br>
KIRK: Prepare to destruct. <br>
KANG: Completing the job you started? <br>
KIRK: You wouldn't be standing here if I had. <br>
SPOCK: First group from the Klingon vessel, Captain. <br>
(Six Klingons including two women materialise. They are hustled away
except one.) <br>
KANG: My wife, Mara, and my science officer. <br>
MARA: Kang, what has happened? <br>
KANG: More Federation treachery. We are prisoners. <br>
MARA: What will they do to us? I've heard of their atrocities, their
death camps. They will torture us for our scientific and military
information. <br>
KIRK: Apparently you have a few things to learn about us. Detain them
in the crew lounge.
Programme the food synthesiser to accommodate our guests. You'll be
well-treated, Kang. <br>
KANG: So I have seen. <br>
(Kang and Mara are led away.) <br>
KIRK: Secure from Red Alert.

KIRK: But maintain general quarters. Scan this sector for other ships.
Run a full check on the colony. I want this thing nailed down fast. <br>
CHEKOV: We know what happened. That distress call. <br>
SPOCK: At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on
Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the
attackers. Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress
call. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHEKOV: Lies. They want to start a war by
pretending that we did. <br>
MCCOY: Chekov may be right. The Klingons claim to have honoured the
truce, but there have been incidents, raids on our outposts. <br>
KIRK: No proof that Klingons committed it. <br>
MCCOY: What proof do we need? We know what a Klingon is. <br>
(Leaves the turbolift.) <br>
SPOCK: Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present
situation. <br>
KIRK: Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that they will be believed. </font></p>

KIRK: Very good, Scotty. Mister Sulu? <br>
SULU: Forward phasers locked and ready to fire, sir. <br>

stuffed and hung on his cabin wall. <br>

KANG: No, they wish to question us, learn our strength, our plans. They
never will. <br>
MARA: We are forty against four hundred. <br>
KLINGON: Four thousand throats may be cut in one night by a running
man. <br>
KANG: Patience. Vigilance. They will make a mistake. Capture of the

are normal. Channels are open. There's still no outside contact! I
don't understand it, sir. Could the Klingons be doing something? <br>
(Then the ship shudders as if from an explosion, and changes course.) <br>

trapped, your ship racing from this galaxy at wild speeds. Delightful.
How did I perform this sabotage, Kirk? All my men are here. <br>
KIRK: Johnson. Get down to Security. Search every section. Some
Klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship. Then
get down to Engineering and help Scotty hammer things back to normal.
And free those trapped crewmen. (to Kang) And before I put you in the
brig, there's a little something I owe you. <br>

which Kang picks up. A potted plant and 3D chess set become swords.) <br>

movement by the Klingons. The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling
tradition. They think they can beat us with swords. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of
this. The instantaneous transmutation of matter. I doubt that they are
responsible. <br>
KIRK: Any other logical candidate? <br>
SPOCK: None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used
it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves? <br>

difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been
drawn. <br>

dying. Atrocities committed on their persons, and you talk about making
peace with these fiends? If our backs were turned, they'd jump us in a
minute. And you know what Klingons do to prisoners. Slave labour, death
planets, experiments! <br>

KIRK: (dictating into PADD) The Enterprise is heading out of our
galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship.
Engineering has been taken over by Klingons who have cut off
life-support systems. Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Captain. <br>
KIRK: Get down to emergency manual control. Try to protect our
life-support circuits and auxiliary power. <br>
SULU: Aye, Captain. <br>
(Sulu leaves as Scott arrives.) <br>
SCOTT: Sir. Chekov was right, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, I'm glad you've come. <br>
SCOTT: We should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter.
That's right where they belong! <br>
KIRK: Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: Non-existence! Now they can study the Enterprise, add our
technology to theirs, change the balance of power. You've jeopardised
the Federation! <br>
KIRK: Scotty, take it easy. <br>
SPOCK: Easy, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Keep your Vulcan hands off me. Just keep away! Your feelings
might be hurt, you green-blooded half-breed! <br>
SPOCK: May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with
humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant. <br>
SCOTT: Then transfer out, freak! <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen! (intervenes as they nearly come to blows.) Spock!
Scotty. Spock. Spock! Stop it! You're half human! What are we saying?
What are we doing to each other? <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. The result of stress? <br>
KIRK: We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's
throats. <br>
SCOTT: But this is war. <br>
KIRK: There isn't any war! Or is there? <br>
SCOTT: Have we forgotten how to defend ourselves? <br>
KIRK: Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in
other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if
necessary. Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at
me. Look at me. Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally
armed. Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology
and patriotic drum beating? Even, Spock, even race hatred? <br>
SPOCK: Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification
of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is
by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns. <br>
KIRK: But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules? <br>
SPOCK: It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately,
and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities. <br>
SCOTT: Without sensors? All our power down? This thing could go
anywhere. <br>
KIRK: Yes. Mister Sulu, report. <br>
SULU [OC]: No good, Captain. </font></p>

it that supports our battle yet starves our victory? Power. Interrupt
it at their main life-support couplings. Where? <br>

hides, then kills the Klingon and takes Mara prisoner.) <br>
CHEKOV: You don't die yet. You're not human, but you're very beautiful.
Very beautiful. <br>
(He rips her top, covers her mouth and I'll leave his intentions to
your imaginations. Kirk comes along in the nick of time.) <br>
KIRK: Chekov! <br>
(He hauls him off Mara and slaps him twice, knocking him out.) <br>
SPOCK: Jim, he's not responsible. <br>
KIRK: What have I done? (to Mara) There's an alien entity aboard the
ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to. We don't know what
its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us. Take me to
Kang. A temporary truce, that's all I ask. Spock, take her. <br>
(Spock and Mara leave) <br>
KIRK: Chekov. Chekov. (picks him up) Is this what's in store for us,
from here on in? Violence, hatred. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's very busy. Kirk carries in Chekov, followed
by Spock and Mara.) <br>
MCCOY: Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened? <br>
KIRK: He lost control. So did I. We're becoming animal warriors. Let's
go, Spock. <br>
MCCOY: Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with
the other casualties. Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma,
shock. They're all healing at a fantastic rate. <br>
SPOCK: It would appear that the entity wants us alive. <br>
KIRK: Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more
like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds? <br>
SPOCK: Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities
are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers. <br>
MCCOY: Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is
extremely sorry. <br>
SPOCK: I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial
bigotry. Most distasteful. <br>
KIRK: Let's find the alien. (to Mara) You come with us. Maybe we can
prove to you that it exists. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The weird light is up ahead of them and glowing
red.) <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: Totally unfamiliar. <br>
KIRK: What do you want? What are you doing here? <br>
JOHNSON: Reporting for duty, sir. <br>
KIRK: Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay? <br>
JOHNSON: I released myself. <br>
KIRK: Then get back to Sickbay! <br>
JOHNSON: Not on your life, sir. I'm fit and ready for action. The
Klingons almost did me in once. I'm out to even the score. <br>
KIRK: I order you <br>
JOHNSON: I've got my orders. I'm obeying orders! Kill the Klingons!
It's them or us, isn't it? <br>
KIRK: Johnson! <br>
(They cross swords, but Spock neck-pinches Johnson.) <br>
(The light becomes yellow.) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his
expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy
level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost
energy. <br>
KIRK: It subsists on the emotions of others. <br>
SPOCK: This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of
hostility, violent intentions. <br>
KIRK: It exists on the hate of others. <br>
SPOCK: To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this
situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together
opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the
most violent mode of conflict. <br>
KIRK: And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain
a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've
got to get rid of it. <br>
SPOCK: Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The
fighting must end and soon. <br>
KIRK: Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies,
filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare. Kang has got to listen.
We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing. (goes to
intercom) Kang. Kang, this is Captain Kirk. </font></p>

so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it. <br>

SPOCK: We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero. <br>SPOCK:
There is, of course, a logical alternative. Kang's wife is, after all,

KIRK: The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners. You've
been listening to propaganda, fables. How much time? <br>
SPOCK: Eight minutes, forty two seconds. <br>
MARA: So this was no trick? <br>
SCOTT: It's the alien that's done this. We're in its power, our people
and yours. <br>
KIRK: We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all. <br>
MARA: We have always fought. We must. We are hunters, Captain, tracking
and taking what we need. There are poor planets in the Klingon systems,
we must push outward if we are to survive. <br>
KIRK: There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help. <br>

KIRK: How? <br>

Intra-ship beaming from one section to another. It's possible? <br>
SPOCK: It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint
accuracy is required. If the transportee should materialise inside a
solid object, a deck or wall. <br>
SCOTT: Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap. <br>

lifetimes. Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total
control over us. <br>

dead. Next time I'll do the same to you. I'll kill you. And it goes on,
the good old game of war, pawn against pawn! Stopping the bad guys.

I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon. <br>

know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like
you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history,
but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you. So ship out!

a fool fights in a burning house. Out! <br>

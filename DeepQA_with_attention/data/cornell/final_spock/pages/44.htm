I'm going to be able to stand this. I feel like my neck's in a sling. <br>
KIRK: The Vulcans are the last delegates we have to pick up. As soon as

the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan

MCCOY: How does that Vulcan salute go? <br>
(Spock demonstrates - right hand with the fingers separated into a

MCCOY: That hurts worse than the uniform. <br>
(A couple are escorted from the shuttlecraft.) <br>
KIRK: Captain James Kirk. <br>
SAREK: Captain. <br>
KIRK: My First Officer, Commander Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve. <br>
SAREK: Your service honours us, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy. <br>
MCCOY: Ambassador. <br>
SAREK: Doctor. My aides and she who is my wife. <br>
(He holds out his right hand with two fingers extended, and a human
woman steps forward to touch them.) <br>
AMANDA: Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Our pleasure, madam. As soon as you're settled I'll arrange a
tour of the ship. Mister Spock will conduct you. <br>
SAREK: I'd prefer another guide, Captain. <br>
KIRK: As you wish, Ambassador. Mister Spock, we'll leave orbit in two
hours. Would you care to beam down and visit your parents? <br>
SPOCK: Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents.

Vulcan for the neutral planetoid code-named Babel. Since it is in our
sector, the Enterprise has been assigned to transport ambassadors of
Federation planets to this vitally important council. The issues of the
council are politically complex, the passengers explosive.

KIRK: This is the engineering section. There are a number of emergency
back-up systems for the main controls. Over here are a number of
control computers. <br>
(Amanda lags behind to talk with her son.) <br>
AMANDA: After all these years among humans, you still haven't learned
to smile. <br>
SPOCK: Humans smile with so little provocation. <br>
AMANDA: And you haven't come to see us in four years, either. <br>
SPOCK: The situation between my father and myself has not changed. <br>
SAREK: My wife, attend. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. A moment, if you please. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Explain the computer components. <br>
SAREK: I gave Spock his first instruction in computers, Captain. He
chose to devote his knowledge to Starfleet instead of the Vulcan
Science Academy. <br>
SPOCK: If you will excuse me, Captain. (leaves) <br>
KIRK: I'm sorry, Ambassador. I did not mean to offend. I thought that <br>
SAREK: Offence is a human emotion. I'm returning to my quarters.
Continue, my wife. (leaves) <br>
KIRK: Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand. <br>
AMANDA: Amanda. I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name. <br>
KIRK: Can you? <br>
AMANDA: After a fashion, and after many years of practice. Shall we
continue the tour? My husband did request it. <br>
KIRK: It sounded more like a command. <br>
AMANDA: Of course. He's a Vulcan. I'm his wife. <br>
KIRK: And Spock is his son. <br>
AMANDA: You don't understand the Vulcan way, Captain. It's logical.
It's a better way than ours. But it's not easy. It has kept Spock and
Sarek from speaking as father and son for eighteen years. <br>
KIRK: Spock is my best officer, and my friend. <br>
AMANDA: I'm glad he has such a friend. It hasn't been easy on Spock.
Neither human nor Vulcan. At home nowhere except Starfleet. <br>
KIRK: I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of
career. <br>
AMANDA: My husband has nothing against Starfleet. But Vulcans believe
that peace should not depend on force. <br>
KIRK: Starfleet force is used only as a last resort. We're an
instrument of civilisation. And it's a better opportunity
for a scientist to study the universe than he can get at the Vulcan
Science Academy. <br>
AMANDA: Perhaps. But Sarek wanted Spock to follow his teachings, as
Sarek followed the teachings of his own father. <br>
KIRK: They are both stubborn. <br>
AMANDA: A human trait, Captain? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here. <br>
UHURA [on monitor]: Captain, I've picked up some sort of signal. Just a
few symbols. Nothing intelligible. <br>
KIRK: Source? <br>
UHURA [on monitor]: That's what bothers me, sir. Impossible to locate.
There wasn't enough of it. Sensors show nothing in the area, but it was
a strong signal, as though it was very close. <br>
KIRK: Go to alert status four. Begin long-range scanning. Kirk out.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, Stardate 3842.4. The interplanetary
conference will consider the petition of the Coridan planets to be
admitted to the Federation. The Coridan system has been claimed by some
of the races now aboard our ship as delegates, races who have strong
personal reasons for keeping Coridan out of the Federation. The most
pressing problem aboard the Enterprise is to
make sure open warfare doesn't break out among the delegates before the
conference begins.

helping themselves to drinks and nibbles from buffet tables.) <br>
MCCOY: Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this
conference was called. Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm
interested in Vulcan physiology. Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to
retire at your age? After all, you're only a hundred and two. <br>
SAREK: One hundred two point four three seven precisely, Doctor,
measured in your years. I had other concerns. <br>
KIRK: Ambassador. <br>
GAV: (a stout chap with a porcine nose) Sarek of Vulcan, do you vote to
admit Coridan to the Federation?&nbsp;<br>
SAREK: The vote will not be taken here, Ambassador Gav. My government's
instructions will be heard in the council chambers on Babel. <br>
GAV: No! You! How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan? <br>
SHRAS: (thin and blue, with two antennae) Why must you know, Tellarite?
<br>
GAV: In council, his vote carries others. I will know where he stands
and why. <br>
SAREK: Tellarites do not argue for reasons. They simply argue. <br>
GAV: No. You <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen. Ambassador Sarek is quite correct when he points out
this is not the council chamber of Babel. I'm fully aware that the
admission of Coridan is a highly debatable issue, but you won't solve
it here. <br>
SAREK: You are correct, Captain. Quite logical. <br>
SHRAS: My apologies, Captain. <br>
GAV: You will excuse me. (stalks away) <br>
SHRAS: Have you met Gav before, Ambassador? <br>
SAREK: We debated during my last council session. Ambassador. <br>
AMANDA: Ambassador Gav lost. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human
than you let on. Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the
Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human
children, even in secret? <br>
AMANDA: Well, he, he did have a pet sehlat he was very fond of. <br>
MCCOY: Sehlat? <br>
AMANDA: It's sort of a fat teddy bear. <br>
MCCOY: A teddy bear? <br>
SAREK: Excuse me, Doctor. It has been a rather long day for my wife.
Captain. <br>
KIRK: Ambassador. <br>
(Sarek leads Amanda away.) <br>
MCCOY: A teddy bear. <br>
SPOCK: Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and
they have six-inch fangs. <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Captain, sensors are registering an unidentified vessel
pacing us. <br>
KIRK: On my way. All duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Don't alarm the
passengers. Kirk out.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Report. <br>
CHEKOV: A small ship, Captain. It's been there five minutes, remaining
outside phaser range at extreme limit of sensors. <br>
KIRK: Identification, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration
is unfamiliar. Most unusual. <br>
KIRK: Does she answer a hail? <br>
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal
translator. No response, sir. <br>
KIRK; Maintain translator broadcast. Check records for authorised
ships. <br>
SPOCK: Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except
ours. <br>
KIRK: Care to guess what she is? <br>
SPOCK: Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel. I want to
see what she looks like close up. <br>
CHEKOV: Aye, sir.

a mother may do that. He is a Vulcan. <br>
AMANDA: He's also human. <br>
SAREK: He's a Starfleet officer. <br>
AMANDA: I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet. <br>
SAREK: It is not a question of approval. The fact exists. He is in
Starfleet. He must command respect if he is to function. <br>
AMANDA: Sarek, you're proud of him, aren't you? You're showing almost
human pride in your son. <br>
SAREK: It does not require pride to ask that Spock be given the respect
which is his due. Not as my son, but as Spock. Do you understand? <br>
AMANDA: Not really, but it doesn't matter. I love you anyway. I know.
It isn't logical. </font></p>

SPOCK: Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten. <br>
KIRK: Back on original course, Mister Chekov. Report on intruder's
movements. <br>
UHURA: Captain, Starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and
confirms no authorised Federation vessel in this quadrant. <br>
CHEKOV: Back on original heading, Captain. The intruder changed course
immediately after we did. It's paralleling us again. <br>
KIRK: Well, we have a shadow. Faster, more manoeuvrable and
unidentified. Mister Spock, full analysis of sensor readings. I want to
know who that intruder is.

GAV: Vulcan, I would speak to you. <br>
SAREK: It does seem unavoidable. <br>
GAV: How do you vote on the Coridan admission? <br>
SAREK: You seem unwilling to wait for the council meeting, Ambassador.
No matter. We favour admission. <br>
GAV: You favour? Why? <br>
(The room goes silent.) <br>
SAREK: Under Federation law, Coridan can be protected and its wealth
administered for the benefit of its people. <br>
GAV: That's well for you. Vulcan has no mining interest. <br>
SAREK: Coridan has nearly unlimited wealth of dilithium crystals, but
it is under-populated
and unprotected. This invites illegal mining operations. <br>
GAV: Illegal? You accuse us? <br>
SAREK: Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium
crystals. <br>
GAV: You call us thieves? <br>
(Gav attacks Sarek, who shrugs him off easily.) <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Whatever arguments you have between
yourselves is your business. My business is running the ship. As long
as I command, there will be order. <br>

MCCOY: Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the
killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly.
<br>
KIRK: Who aboard would have that knowledge? <br>
SPOCK: Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was
considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times. <br>
KIRK: Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and
your father. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain? Interesting. <br>
MCCOY: Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the
most likely suspect? <br>
SPOCK: Vulcans do not approve of violence. <br>
KIRK: You're saying he couldn't have done it? <br>
SPOCK: No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill
without reason. <br>
KIRK: But if he had a reason, could he have done it? <br>
SPOCK: If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing.
Logically and efficiently.

private before retiring. What's wrong? Spock? <br>

as tal-shaya. <br>
SAREK: Indeed? Interesting. <br>
KIRK: Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour? <br>
AMANDA: Captain, you're not accusing him? <br>
SPOCK: Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical
suspect. <br>
SAREK: I quite agree. <br>
KIRK: Then where were you during the hour? <br>
SAREK: In private meditation, Captain. Spock will tell you that such
meditation is a personal experience, not to be discussed.
especially not with Earthmen. <br>
KIRK: That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador. <br>
(Sarek suddenly collapses.) <br>
AMANDA: Sarek. Sarek. What's wrong? <br>

something to do with his cardiovascular system. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the
alien ship's hull. <br>
KIRK: I'm sorry about your father. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, it could adversely affect our mission. <br>
KIRK: Aren't you worried about him? <br>
SPOCK: Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened.
The ship's hull seems to have a high density level
or is cloaked against sensor probes. It is manned, but sensors cannot
make out specifics. <br>
KIRK: I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the
Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons? <br>
SPOCK: I think it unlikely it is one of theirs. <br>
KIRK: Who, then? <br>
UHURA: Captain? I picked up the last part of a transmission. Just like
that other one. I put the recorder and the directional locator on it
immediately. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing
twenty seven, mark eight. <br>
CHEKOV: It's the intruder ship, sir. <br>
KIRK: Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant.
<br>
UHURA: Sir, the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere
within the body of this ship. <br>
KIRK: A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that
vessel? <br>
SPOCK: Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission. <br>
KIRK: Why not? <br>
SPOCK: It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No
standard references apply. <br>
KIRK: Are any conclusions possible from the information? <br>
SPOCK: Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is
alien. <br>
KIRK: Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got
your sensor locator on a wide beam. You've established a receiver on
board this vessel. Tighten your field to the interior of the ship. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know
who on board the Enterprise is receiving.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Bones, how is he? <br>
MCCOY: As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect
has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart
attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell
without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks? <br>
AMANDA: No. <br>
SAREK: Yes. There were three others. My physician prescribed
Benjisidrine for the condition. <br>
AMANDA: Why didn't you tell me? <br>
SAREK: There was nothing you could have done. <br>
KIRK: Ambassador, when did you have these attacks? <br>
SAREK: Two before we left Vulcan, the third a few hours ago. I was on
the observation deck. When the Tellarite was murdered,
I was quite incapacitated. <br>
KIRK: There were no witnesses? <br>
SAREK: None. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect? <br>
MCCOY: I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an
ordinary operation's out of the question. <br>
KIRK: Why? <br>
SAREK: Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart. <br>
SPOCK: I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the
logical approach. <br>
SAREK: Yes, unquestionably. <br>
KIRK: Bones, what about it? <br>
MCCOY: Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well,
the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of
blood for the patient. <br>
CHAPEL: Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Yes. <br>
CHAPEL: I've checked the blood bank. There isn't enough Vulcan blood
and plasma to even begin such an operation of this type. <br>
KIRK: There are other Vulcans aboard. <br>
SAREK: My blood type is T-negative. Somewhat rare, even for a Vulcan. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I'd say that's rare. <br>
SPOCK: My blood is T-negative, Doctor. <br>
CHAPEL: We've run a number of blood tests on Mister Spock. It isn't
true Vulcan blood either. It has human blood elements in it. <br>
SPOCK: It should be possible to filter out the human factors. <br>
MCCOY: Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill
you. <br>
KIRK: Bones. <br>
MCCOY: Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small
to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed. I would estimate the odds <br>
AMANDA: Please don't. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian. <br>
SPOCK: Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan. <br>
MCCOY: Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental. <br>
SPOCK: But it does look promising. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if
the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm
doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level. <br>
SPOCK: I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable. <br>
MCCOY: Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've
studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But
that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't
kill him with the operation, the drug probably will. <br>
AMANDA: What drug, Doctor? My husband is asleep. What drug? <br>
MCCOY: A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of
blood in the body. It's only experimental. <br>
SPOCK: It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five. <br>
MCCOY: It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In
Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him. <br>
SPOCK: Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would
you pull those records, please? <br>
CHAPEL: Already pulled. You're perfectly healthy, Mister Spock. <br>
MCCOY: What has that got <br>
AMANDA: You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to
your father. <br>
SPOCK: It would seem the only answer. <br>
MCCOY: It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry,
Spock. I can't sanction it. <br>
AMANDA: And I refuse to permit it. I won't risk both of you. <br>
SPOCK: Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor,
have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will
die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering
myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me.

centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart. <br>
SPOCK: I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner. <br>
CHAPEL: (monitoring Sarek) Doctor, the K2 factor is dropping. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I
have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared. <br>
SPOCK: No, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: What? <br>
SPOCK: My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety
is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an
alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under
these circumstances. <br>
MCCOY: You can turn command over to Scotty. <br>
SPOCK: On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise
personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian.

know nothing of him except that he has served adequately. <br>
SPOCK: He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and
truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so
conditioned as part of a preconceived plan. <br>
SHRAS: My people are a violent race, but we've no quarrel with Captain
Kirk. <br>
SPOCK: Apparently Thelev did. <br>
SHRAS: You suggest a plot. How could it profit us to harm the captain? <br>
SPOCK: I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the
captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder. <br>
SHRAS: Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to
motivations of passion or gain. Those are reasons for murder.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Spock's quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The doorbell rings impatiently.) <br>
SPOCK: Come in. <br>
AMANDA: Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else. <br>
SPOCK: Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out
responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified. <br>
AMANDA: Any competent officer can command this ship. Only you can give
your father the blood transfusions that he needs to live. <br>
SPOCK: Any competent officer can command this ship under normal
circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over
one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an
alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and
attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties. <br>
AMANDA: Duty? Your duty is to your father. <br>
SPOCK: I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the
transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would.
Sarek understands my reason. <br>
AMANDA: Well, I don't. It's not human. That's not a dirty word. You're
human, too. Let that part of you come through. Your father's dying. <br>
SPOCK: Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a
Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to
be a Vulcan? <br>
AMANDA: If this is what it means, I don't want to know. <br>
SPOCK: It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical
and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal
gain, no matter how important that gain might be. <br>
AMANDA: Nothing is as important as your father's life. <br>
SPOCK: Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if
I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives,
risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? <br>
AMANDA: When you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped,
anguished, because the other boys tormented you saying that you weren't
really Vulcan. I watched you, knowing that inside that the human part
of you was crying and I cried, too. There must be some part of me in
you, some part that I still can reach. If being Vulcan is more
important to you, then you'll stand there speaking rules and
regulations from Starfleet and Vulcan philosophy, and let your father
die. And I'll hate you for the rest of my life. <br>
SPOCK: Mother <br>
AMANDA: Oh, go to him. Now. Please. <br>
SPOCK: I cannot. <br>

MCCOY: I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's
going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs
Sarek his life. Regulations. <br>

going to let him commit patricide. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again. <br>
KIRK: Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't
operate without transfusions from Spock. I'll convince Spock I'm all
right and order him to report here. As soon as he leaves the bridge,
I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters. Will that

self-destruct. <br>
(While in Sickbay, Sarek's vital signs are strengthening.) <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command. Tell them we have a
prisoner. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>

self-destruct, too. Slow poison. Quite painless, actually, but there's
no known antidote. I anticipate another ten minutes of life. <br>

I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible. <br>
SPOCK: I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Orion? <br>
SPOCK: Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the
Coridan system. <br>
KIRK: But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet? <br>
SAREK: Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war. <br>
KIRK: Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up
supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan. <br>
SPOCK: The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It
made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us.
That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they never
intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred
percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I
didn't think of it earlier. <br>
KIRK: You might have had something else on your mind. <br>
SPOCK: That hardly seems likely. <br>
KIRK: No, but thank you anyway. <br>
AMANDA: And you, Sarek. Would you also say thank you to your son? <br>
SAREK: I don't understand. <br>
AMANDA: For saving your life. <br>
SAREK: Spock acted in the only logical manner open to him. One does not
thank logic, Amanda. <br>

how I feel about your logic? <br>

to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be
out in two. <br>

MCCOY: You are at your station, Mister Spock. <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Captain, we've reached the designated
position for scanning the coded directive tape. <br>
KIRK: Good. (puts it into a decoder) We both guessed right.
Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down.
Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack. We are to proceed to
Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons
from using it as a base. <br>
SPOCK: Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the
disputed area, ideally located for use by either side. <br>
KIRK: Organia's description, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living
on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D
minus on Richter's scale of cultures. <br>
KIRK: Another Armenia, Belgium. <br>
SPOCK: Sir? <br>
KIRK: The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural
invasion routes. <br>
SULU: Captain, the automatic deflector screen just popped on. Body
approaching. <br>
KIRK: Configuration, Mister Sulu. <br>
(Everyone is thrown about as the Enterprise is hit by multiple weapons
fire.) <br>
KIRK: Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One
hundred percent dispersal pattern. <br>
SPOCK: We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt. <br>
KIRK: Damage control, report to the first officer. <br>
SULU: Captain, the other ship doesn't register. Only drifting debris.
We got him. <br>
KIRK: All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage
report, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks
ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very
light. <br>
KIRK: Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: No contact, Captain. He blew up all right. <br>
KIRK: Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just
experienced very nearly qualifies. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act. <br>
UHURA: Automatic all-points relay from Starfleet Command, Captain, code
one. <br>
KIRK: Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it. <br>
SPOCK: Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do
not want. <br>
KIRK: War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the
Klingons. <br>
SPOCK: With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy. <br>
KIRK: Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain,
and time is one thing we'll have the least of. <br>
KIRK: We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled.
We have to get there before the hammer falls. Ahead warp factor seven.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA: Captain. Unit XY-75847 report a fleet of
Klingon ships in their sector, sir. <br>
KIRK: What bearing? <br>
UHURA: Unable to ascertain, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full
power deflector screens. <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be
in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is
that clear? <br>
SULU: Perfectly, sir. <br>
KIRK: The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will
be a target. If they should emerge <br>
SULU: We'll handle them, sir. <br>
KIRK: You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them,
you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: But, Captain <br>
KIRK: No buts. You'll get to safety and alert the fleet. You will not
attack alone. Mister Spock and I will be all right. Mister Spock, let's
you and I pay the Organians a visit. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They beam down in front of a vaguely castle-styled
wall which is completely smooth. The locals are dressed in romanticised
rural
mediaeval-style clothing, and take no notice of them at all.) <br>
KIRK: You'd think they had people beaming down every day. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance,
Captain. Quite large. <br>
KIRK: Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle. <br>
SPOCK: Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the
reports we've been given on this culture. <br>
(A man in a loose purple robe opens his arms wide.) <br>
AYELBORNE: Welcome. <br>
KIRK: Reception committee? <br>
SPOCK: It would seem so. <br>
AYELBORNE: You are our visitors. Welcome, welcome. I am Ayelborne. <br>
KIRK: I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise,
representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer
Mister Spock. <br>
AYELBORNE: You are most welcome, my friend. <br>
KIRK: I would like to speak to someone in authority. <br>
AYELBORNE: We don't have anybody in authority, but I am the chairman of
the Council of Elders. Perhaps I would do. <br>
KIRK: You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and
talk? <br>
AYELBORNE: Oh, yes. Our council chambers are nearby. Please. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the
village and make some studies. <br>
AYELBORNE: Of course, my friend. Our village is yours. Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Council Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ayelborne and four other older men seat themselves
at a simple wooden table. Beautifully polished, though.) <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are
expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a
base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to
keep them from doing it. <br>
AYELBORNE: What you're saying, Captain, is that we seem to have a
choice between dealing with you or your enemies. <br>
KIRK: No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none
with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is
their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very
unpleasant. We offer you protection. <br>
CLAYMARE: We thank you for your altruistic offer, Captain, but we
really do not need your protection. <br>
AYELBORNE: We are a simple people, Captain. We have nothing that
anybody could want. <br>
KIRK: You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you
that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move
against you
as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build
facilities. <br>
AYELBORNE: We have no defences, Captain, nor are any needed. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like
yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms
whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed,
your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet.
Infinitely better off. <br>
AYELBORNE: Captain, we see that your concern is genuine. We are moved.
But again we assure you we are in absolutely no danger. If anybody is
in danger, you are, and that concerns us greatly. It would be better if
you returned to your ship as soon as possible. <br>
KIRK: You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there
is. Would you mind telling me <br>
AYELBORNE: It is our way of life, Captain. <br>
KIRK: That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. I can only tell you the truth. <br>
AYELBORNE: If you will excuse us, Captain, we will discuss your kind
offer. <br>
KIRK: Certainly. <br>
(The doors open on their own and Spock enters. He and Kirk whisper in a
corner.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, our information on these people and their culture was
not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward
mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any
progress as far back as my tricorder can register. <br>
KIRK: That doesn't seem likely. <br>
SPOCK: Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there
has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their
physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested
culture. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful. <br>
AYELBORNE: We have discussed your offer, Captain. Our opinion is
unchanged. We are in no danger. We thank you for your kind offer of
assistance, although we must decline it, and we strongly recommend that
you leave Organia before you yourselves are endangered. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense
help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists,
technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one
was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the
latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are
almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease,
hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you.
Now. <br>
AYELBORNE: Captain, I can see that you do not understand us. Perhaps <br>
KIRK: (answering communicator) Excuse me, sir. Kirk here. <br>
SULU: Captain, a large number of Klingon vessels have just arrived. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SULU: They're opening fire. <br>
KIRK [OC]: Positive identification? <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. My screens are up. I can't drop them to beam you
aboard. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Council Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of
here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out.
Gentlemen, you kept insisting that there was no danger <br>
AYELBORNE: That is correct, Captain. There is no danger. <br>
TREFAYNE: Ayelborne, eight space vehicles have assumed orbit around our
planet. They are activating their material transmission units. <br>
AYELBORNE: Thank you, Trefayne. <br>
KIRK: Can you verify that? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development. <br>
AYELBORNE: Captain, since it is too late for you to escape, perhaps we
should do something about protecting you. <br>
KIRK: If you had listened to me <br>
CLAYMARE: We must be sure you are not harmed. <br>
TREFAYNE: Ayelborne, several hundred men have appeared near the
citadel. They bring many weapons. <br>
KIRK: How does he know that? <br>
AYELBORNE: Oh, our friend Trefayne is really quite intuitive. You can
rest assured that what he says is absolutely correct. <br>
KIRK: So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation
army. <br>
SPOCK: So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect. <br>
KIRK: You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very
pleasant prospect at all.

are trapped on the planet Organia, which is in the process of being

provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for
Organians.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Captain, our phasers are gone. <br>
KIRK: Did you take them? <br>
AYELBORNE: Yes, Captain. I took them. <br>
KIRK: I must ask you to return them. <br>
AYELBORNE: I'm sorry, Captain. I cannot do that. Were you armed, you
might be tempted to use violence, and that we cannot permit. You,
Captain, will pass as an Organian, and Mister Spock. Mister Spock
presents a problem. He doesn't look like an Organian. <br>
CLAYMARE: A Vulcan trader, perhaps. A dealer in kevas and trillium.
Harmless to the Klingons. <br>
KIRK: They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation. <br>
SPOCK: Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical
approach. <br>
KIRK: What about the rest of you? <br>
AYELBORNE: We shall continue as before. We have nothing to fear. <br>
KIRK: You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll
be learning it the hard way. <br>
(The doors open on their own, and two Klingons march in, followed by
their leader.)&nbsp;<br>
KOR: This is the ruling council? <br>
AYELBORNE: I am Ayelborne, temporary head of the council. I bid you
welcome. <br>
KOR: No doubt you do. I am Kor, military governor of Organia. (looking
at Kirk) Who are you? <br>
AYELBORNE: He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens. <br>
KOR: And he has no tongue? <br>
KIRK: I have a tongue. <br>
KOR: Good. You will be taught how to use it. Where is your smile? <br>
KIRK: My what? <br>
KOR: The stupid, idiotic smile everyone else seems to be wearing. A
Vulcan. Do you also have a tongue? <br>
SPOCK: I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium. <br>
KOS: You do not look like a storekeeper. Take this man. Vulcans are
members of the Federation. He may be a spy. <br>
KIRK: He's no spy. <br>
KOR: Well, have we a ram among the sheep? Do you object to us taking
him? <br>
KIRK: He's done nothing. Nothing at all. <br>
KOR: Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an act of rebellion.
Very good. (to the Council) So you welcome me. (to Kirk) Do you also
welcome me? <br>
KIRK: You're here. There's nothing I can do about it. <br>
KOR: Good honest hatred. Very refreshing. However, it makes no
difference whether you welcome me or not. I am here and will stay. You
are now subjects of the Klingon Empire. You'll find there are many
rules and regulations. They will be posted. Violation of the smallest
of them will be punished by death. <br>
AYELBORNE: We shall obey your regulations, Commander. <br>
KOR: You disapprove, Baroner. <br>
KIRK: You need my approval? <br>
KOR: I need your obedience. Nothing more. Will I have it? <br>
KIRK: You seem to be in command. <br>
KOR: Yes. I am. I shall need a representative from among you. Liaison
between the forces of the occupation and the civil population. Smile
and smile. I don't trust men who smile too much. You, Baroner, you're
the man. <br>
KIRK: Me? I don't want the job. <br>
KOR: Have I asked whether or not you want it? We Klingons have a
reputation for ruthlessness. You will find that it is deserved. Should
one Klingon soldier be killed, a thousand Organians will die. I will
have order. Is that clear? <br>
AYELBORNE: Commander, I assure you our people want nothing but peace.
We shall cause you no trouble. <br>
KOR: I'm sure you will not. Take the Vulcan to the examination room.
(to Kirk) You, come with me. I will familiarise you with your new
duties. <br>
KIRK: And Mister Spock? <br>
KOR: You are concerned? <br>
KIRK: He is my friend. <br>
KOR: You have a poor choice of friends. He will be examined. If he is
lying, he will die. If he is telling the truth, he will find that
business has taken a turn for the worse. Take him. You do not like to
be pushed. Very good. You may be a man I can deal with, Baroner. Come
with me. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Probably up in the old castle.) <br>
KOR: From this day on, no public assemblages of more than three people.
All publications to be cleared through this office. Neighbourhood
controls will be established, hostages selected. A somewhat lengthy
list of crimes against the state. <br>
(Kor hands the proclamation to Kirk, who puts it down on the desk.) <br>
KOR: You do not like them? (Spock is brought in.) Well? <br>
KLINGON: He is what he claims to be, Commander, a Vulcanian merchant
named Spock. His main concern seems to be how he would carry out his
business under our occupation. <br>
KOR: Nothing else? <br>
KLINGON: The usual. A certain amount of apprehension regarding us. The
mind is remarkably disciplined. <br>
KOR: You are sure? <br>
KLINGON: I used force four, which is sufficient to break down any
pretence. <br>
KOR: Very well, Lieutenant. Would you like to try our little truth
finder? <br>
KIRK: I don't understand. <br>
KOR: It's a mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on how much force is
used. We can record every thought, every bit of knowledge in a man's
mind. Of course, when that much force is used, the mind is emptied.
Permanently, I'm afraid. What's left is more vegetable than human. <br>
KIRK: And you're proud of it. <br>
KOR: It is a tool, a weapon. Somewhat drastic, but very efficient. <br>
KIRK: Are you sure you're all right? <br>
SPOCK: Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience. <br>
KOR: All right, Vulcan, you may go. But you are an enemy alien. You
will be under our scrutiny at all times. If I have to warn you <br>
SPOCK: Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well. <br>
(He leaves, followed by the guard.) <br>
KOR: Return to your council, Baroner. You will receive our official
notifications as soon as they are published. In the meantime keep the
people in order. It is your responsibility. <br>
KIRK: Or I will be killed. <br>
KOR: That is exactly right. You will be killed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: That mindsifter can't be all the terror they
think it is. <br>
SPOCK: It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly
into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past)
certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield. Without those
disciplines, there would be no protection. <br>
KIRK: I'll try and avoid it. <br>
KLINGON 2: Out of the way, Organian. <br>
SPOCK: I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you. <br>
KLINGON 2: Next time, keep your eyes open, or I'll shut them
permanently. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the
immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here. <br>
KIRK: You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?
<br>
SPOCK: I thought you might. <br>
KIRK: You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do. <br>
SPOCK: We'll receive no help from the Organians. <br>
KIRK: Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the
Klingons run things. If we could prove to them they could do something
to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance. <br>
SPOCK: Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct
approach? <br>
KIRK: That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I
not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's
headquarters? <br>
SPOCK: You did. <br>
KIRK: I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating.
Tonight. <br>
SPOCK: A very meritorious idea, Captain. <br>
KIRK: We're short of tools. <br>
SPOCK: I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.
It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock. </font></p>

SPOCK: With a delayed action fuse. <br>
KIRK; Good. <br>
SPOCK: These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a
most satisfactory display. <br>
(He casually drops the grenade into a box, and they run.) <br>

be sheep, you can be wolves. <br>
CLAYMARE: Terrible to destroy. <br>
KIRK: History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back
successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to
destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their
installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to
them. <br>
SPOCK: Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is
ours. It can be a successful one. <br>
AYELBORNE: Captain, I implore you never to do such a thing again. <br>
KIRK: Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom
mean so little to you? <br>

tell you his name. It is Captain James T. Kirk. <br>

KOR: What? (A big grin spreads across his face) Captain of the USS
Enterprise. A starship commander. And his first officer? I had hoped to
meet you in battle, but <br>
AYELBORNE: For some reason, he feels that he must destroy you,
Commander, just as you feel you must destroy him. <br>
KOR: That's going to be rather difficult now. Isn't it, Captain? What
an admirable people. Do you always betray your friends? <br>
AYELBORNE: I didn't want you to harm him. I'm sorry, Captain. It was
for the best. No harm would come of it. <br>

admiration for you. I know, of course, that it was you who destroyed
our supplies last night. <br>
KIRK: Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope. <br>
KOR: Hardly. They were quite important to us, but they can be replaced.
You of the Federation, you are much like us. <br>
KIRK: We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body. <br>
KOR: Come now. I'm not referring to minor ideological differences. I
mean that we are similar as a species. Here we are on a planet of
sheep. Two tigers, predators, hunters, killers, and it is precisely
that which makes us great. And there is a universe to be taken. <br>
KIRK: It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't
like the Klingons. <br>

very little of your mind left, Captain. I have no desire
to see you become a vegetable. This friend of yours, the Vulcan. He
seems to have the ability to block our scanner. I think perhaps I will
find out why. I will have him dissected. Your friend killed. You, a
mental vegetable. Not a pleasant prospect, Captain, but it lies ahead
for you unless you tell me everything I want to know. Twelve hours,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: It will take a lot longer than that, Commander. <br>
KOR: Longer than that I will not wait. I respect you, Captain, but this
is war, a game we Klingons play to win. Take him to the cell with his
friend. And watch him closely. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It's a traditional mediaeval castle cell, big iron
grills, straw on the floor, lit by ever-burning torches in sconces on
the walls.) <br>
SPOCK: It's no use, Jim. There's no way out. <br>
(Later.) <br>
KIRK: How much of the twelve hours do we have left? <br>
SPOCK: Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual. <br>
KIRK: I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that
munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry
the attack directly to Kor. These Organians <br>
SPOCK: They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar. <br>
KIRK: Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some
attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation. <br>
SPOCK: We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick. <br>
KIRK: And there are guards every few feet down the hall. <br>
(There are sounds outside, then the door swings silently open on it's
own. Spock and Kirk are ready to pounce on whoever enters.) <br>
AYELBORNE: Oh, there you are, gentlemen. I trust you are in good
health? Shall we go? <br>
KIRK: Go? <br>
AYELBORNE: Yes. Your captors plan to do violence to you. That we cannot
permit. I came to take you away. <br>
KIRK: You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now? <br>

waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again

SPOCK: Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel. <br>

you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence
than you know what to do with. <br>

quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some
things worth dying for. <br>

that what you intend to do will be hopeless? <br>

them.) <br>

odds on our getting out of here? <br>

7,824.7 to 1. <br>

invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive.

vital supplies, strangle our trade! You've been asking for war! <br>

disputed areas! <br>

war. All your military forces, wherever they are, are now completely
paralysed. <br>

disgusting, but you gentlemen have given us no choice. <br>

right to dictate to our Federation <br>
KOR: Or our Empire! <br>
KIRK: How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right <br>
AYELBORNE: To wage war, Captain? To kill millions of innocent people?
To destroy life on a planetary scale? Is that what you're defending? <br>
KIRK: Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People
have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we will have <br>
AYELBORNE: Oh, eventually you will have peace, but only after millions
of people have died. It is true that in the future, you and the
Klingons will become fast friends. You will work together. <br>
KOR: Never! <br>
CLAYMARE: Your emotions are most discordant. We do not wish to seem
inhospitable, but gentlemen, you must leave. <br>
AYELBORNE: Yes, please leave us. The mere presence of beings like
yourselves is intensely painful to us. <br>
KIRK: What do you mean, beings like yourselves? <br>
AYELBORNE: Millions of years ago, Captain, we were humanoid like
yourselves, but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies.
That of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake. <br>
KOR: Captain, it's a trick. We can handle them. I have an army. <br>
(Kirk holds him back as Ayelborne and Claymare transform into pulsating
lights, too bright to look at. Then they disappear.) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not
life as we know it at all. <br>
KIRK: But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this
citadel? <br>
SPOCK: Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians.
Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional
points of reference. <br>
KOR: But is all of this possible? <br>
SPOCK: We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians
are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the
amoeba. <br>
KIRK: Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war. Obviously,
the Organians aren't going to let us fight. <br>

Organia. <br>
KIRK: I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a
war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in
the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve
into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.
You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the
odds. <br>
KIRK: Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't
have a chance. The Organians raided the game. </font> </p>

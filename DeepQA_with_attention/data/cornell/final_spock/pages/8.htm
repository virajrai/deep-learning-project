Captain Ramart, I'm Captain Kirk. <br>
RAMART: This is my navigator Tom Nellis. <br>
KIRK: How do you do? <br>
NELLIS: How do you do? <br>
RAMART: And this is our young castaway Charlie, Charlie Evans. His
dossier. <br>
KIRK: Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.
<br>
RAMART: Wonderful boy, Charlie. Its been an honour having him aboard. <br>
NELLIS: Why, it's been a great pleasure. The things that he's learned
in the last <br>
RAMART: Absolutely. To think this boy spent practically his whole life
alone on that planet. Everyone killed, just a few microtapes to learn
from. <br>
CHARLIE: How many humans like me on this ship? <br>
RAMART: Like a whole city in space, Charlie. Over four hundred in the
crew of a starship, aren't there, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we
can do for you, Captain? Medical supplies, provisions? <br>
CHARLIE: Hundreds. All human, like me. That's exciting. Is that the
right word? <br>
NELLIS: That's perfect. It's the exact word. <br>
RAMART: You see. We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his
closest living relatives on Colony Five and your vessel going that way,
why <br>
CHARLIE: I'd like to see your ship now. All of it. The people and
everything. <br>
KIRK: You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong. <br>
CHARLIE: I'm sorry. <br>
KIRK: We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen. <br>
RAMART: No, we've a tight schedule to make, Captain. Just twenty of us,
we're making out fine. <br>
KIRK: This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need
anything? <br>
RAMART: Nothing. <br>
KIRK: Not even Sarian brandy? <br>
RAMART: We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. (the pair are beamed off) <br>
KIRK: Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and
drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will. <br>
RAND: Yes, sir. Come with me, please. <br>
CHARLIE: Are you a girl? Is that a girl? <br>
KIRK: That's a girl.

CHARLIE: After that I found other things to eat, just growing around. <br>
MCCOY: And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes? <br>
CHARLIE: The memory banks still worked. They talked to me, and I talked
back. <br>
MCCOY: You're four-oh. <br>
CHARLIE: Four? <br>
MCCOY: Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb. <br>
CHARLIE: That, that Captain. Kirk? <br>
MCCOY: Yeah. <br>
CHARLIE: Why does he call me Mister Evans? <br>
MCCOY: Because that's your name. <br>
CHARLIE: He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart. <br>
MCCOY: Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie. <br>
CHARLIE: Do you like me? <br>
MCCOY: Why not? <br>
CHARLIE: Some, the other ship, they didn't like me. I tried. I'm trying
to make people like me. I want them to like me. <br>

UHURA: Excuse me, Captain. Status report. <br>

Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like
you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of,
um, er, adolescence. <br>
MCCOY: Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image
like you? He already looks up to you. <br>
KIRK: The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians? <br>
KIRK: Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still
exist on that planet in some form? <br>
SPOCK: Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some
intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived
alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year
or so. <br>
MCCOY: By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables. <br>
SPOCK: Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life. <br>
MCCOY: And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock. <br>
MCCOY: Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally? <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he
needs our help. <br>
MCCOY: And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim. <br>

that, or find him one.

UHURA: I think it's all right, sir. Sir, there's no reason for that
panel to cross-circuit like that. I checked it over myself not fifteen
minutes ago. <br>
NAVIGATOR: Captain! I can't feed any course co-ordinates into the
panel, sir. It rejects the course change. <br>
PILOT: Helm doesn't respond either, sir. (Charlie enters) <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest
of the night. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's
Martian red. <br>
CHARLIE: You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I
want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can. <br>
KIRK: Release the transmitter. <br>
CHARLIE: You don't need all that subspace chatter. <br>
MCCOY: What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into
some kind of poetry. <br>
KIRK: See to her, Doctor. <br>
SPOCK: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary. <br>
CHARLIE: Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl
around, laugh, anything. <br>
KIRK: That's enough, Charlie. <br>
CHARLIE: Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny. <br>
KIRK: Leave my crew alone. (Charlie leaves) <br>
SPOCK: Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down. <br>
KIRK: I know.

RAND: I'll lock it when I please. What is it you want, anyway? <br>
CHARLIE: You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything.
Just, just tell me. <br>

RAND: No!&nbsp;<br>
(Kirk and Spock rush in, Charlie knocks them down.)&nbsp;<br>
RAND: Charlie!&nbsp;<br>
(She slaps him, so he makes her disappear.) <br>
CHARLIE: Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all.
What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain. The
Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares. Running the Antares was easy.
You have to be nice. All right? (gives pain) <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: My legs. They're broken. <br>
KIRK: Let him go, too, Charlie. <br>
CHARLIE: Why? <br>
KIRK: Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship,
and I need him. <br>
CHARLIE: If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go
away. <br>
KIRK: And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed? <br>
CHARLIE: I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and
I can do anything! You can't.

Charlie makes the wall go away and freezes Kirk and Spock.) <br>CHARLIE: That wasn't
nice. You'll be sorry. You wait, you'll see, you'll be sorry you did
that. (unfreezes them) You will.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA: Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're
receiving a message on subspace frequency three, ship-to-ship. I can't
hear it, sir. <br>
KIRK: Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one
that's coming in. <br>
CHARLIE: It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said,
that's how the game's played. You can have it now. I've locked on
course for Colony Five again. (leaves) <br>
KIRK: I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on. <br>
MCCOY: You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far
enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Out of the question. <br>
KIRK: Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away
with anybody since he took over? <br>
SPOCK: Not so far as we know. <br>
KIRK: Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big
ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power,
turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of
it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you
could
tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five. <br>
MCCOY: Risky, Jim. <br>
KIRK: If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no
choice, gentlemen, none at all. <br>
CHARLIE: I can make you all go away anytime I want to. <br>
KIRK: Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now. <br>
CHARLIE: I've got your ship, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I
think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but
you're going to have to. <br>
CHARLIE: I could've sent you away before, but I didn't. <br>
KIRK: You're going to have to take me on. <br>
CHARLIE: Don't make me do it now. <br>
KIRK: You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back,
whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of
command chair) <br>
CHARLIE: Don't push me. (gives Kirk pain) Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop
it. I said stop it! <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is
answering the helm. <br>
UHURA: Sir, something off our starboard bow. The message says they're
from Thasus.&nbsp;<br>
(Rand reappears) <br>
CHARLIE: Oh. <br>
RAND: Captain, how did I? <br>
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman. <br>
SPOCK: Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors
indicate no solid substance. <br>
CHARLIE: No! Oh, no, please, don't let them take me. I can't live with
them anymore. You're my friends. You said you were my friends,
remember? When I came aboard! Please, I want to go home. Take me home. <br>
THASIAN: I have taken my form from centuries ago, so that I may
communicate with you. We did not realise until too late that the boy
had gone, and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the
first ship. We could not help them, but we have returned your people
and your ship to you. Everything is as it was. <br>
CHARLIE: I won't do it again. Please, I'll be good. I won't ever do it
again. I'm sorry about the Antares. I'm sorry! When I came aboard!
Please, I want to go with you. Help me! <br>
KIRK: The boy belongs with his own kind. <br>
THASIAN: That would be impossible. <br>
KIRK: With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can
be taught not to use his power <br>
THASIAN: We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it,
always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced
to destroy him to save yourselves. <br>
KIRK: Is there nothing you can do? <br>
THASIAN: We offer him life, and we will take care of him. Come,
Charles. <br>
CHARLIE: Oh, please, don't let them take me. I can't even touch them!
Janice, they can't feel. Not like you! They don't love!
Please, I want to stay. (fades away) <br>
UHURA: Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir. They signal
they're leaving. <br>
KIRK: It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now. </font> </p>

KIRK: Which one of you is Tongo Rad? <br>
(A purple haired lad with shaggy eyebrows stands up) <br>
KIRK: You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not
under arrest. In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to
charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and
endangering the lives of others as well as your own. <br>
RAD: I'm bleeding. <br>
KIRK: In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have
destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the

have been radiation from the explosion. <br>

One. <br>
SPOCK: One is the beginning. <br>
ADAM: (A red-headed youth) Are you One, Herbert? <br>
SPOCK: I am not Herbert. <br>
ADAM: He is not Herbert. We reach. <br>
SPOCK: If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we
can arrive at a mutual understanding. <br>
SEVRIN: If you understand One, you know our purpose. <br>
SPOCK: I would prefer that you state it. <br>
SEVRIN: We turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning. <br>
SPOCK: What is your destination? <br>
SEVRIN: The planet Eden. <br>
KIRK: That planet it is a myth. <br>
SEVRIN: And we protest against being harassed, pursued, attacked,
seized and transported here against our wishes. <br>
ADAM: Right, brother. <br>
SEVRIN: We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the existence of
hostilities. We recognise no authority save that within ourselves. <br>
KIRK: Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this
ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably.
From there you'll be ferried to your various planets. Because of my
orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests. I expect you to behave as
such. <br>
ADAM: Oh, Herbert, you are stiff! <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal
with them. <br>
SEVRIN: We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. <br>
KIRK: And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're
escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they
need. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. <br>
SEVRIN: We respectfully request that you take us to Eden. <br>

the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora. Regrettably, the
space cruiser itself was destroyed. <br>

KIRK: Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, what is it? <br>
CHEKOV: Sir, I believe I know one of them. At least, I think I
recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet
Academy together. <br>
KIRK: One of those was in the Academy? <br>
CHEKOV: Yes, sir. She dropped out. She <br>
KIRK: Do you wish to see her? Permission to leave your post. <br>
CHEKOV: Thank you, sir. <br>
(Spock enters) <br>
KIRK: Are they in the Sickbay? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. <br>
(Chekov leaves) <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists? <br>
SPOCK: Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not
unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man <br>
KIRK: Doctor Sevrin is their leader? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics,
communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his
post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's
extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. <br>
KIRK: Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology
provides. And they seek the primitive. <br>
SPOCK: There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.
It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the
planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced
atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes. <br>
KIRK: All do. The cave is deep in our memory. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, that is true, Captain. <br>
KIRK: But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible
children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them? <br>
SPOCK: It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to
understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a
condition with which I am somewhat familiar. <br>
KIRK: Spock. What does Herbert mean? <br>
SPOCK: It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor
official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. <br>
KIRK: Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.

CHEKOV: You never felt as I did. Never. <br>
IRINA: I did. <br>
CHEKOV: You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were
close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else.
Why did you stay away? <br>
IRINA: Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now. Oh, Pavel,
you have always been like this. So correct. And inside, the struggle
not to be. Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see. <br>

SEVRIN: I refuse to accept your findings. <br>
MCCOY: You don't have the choice. <br>
SEVRIN: They're the product of prejudice, not science. <br>

happened had he settled there. <br>

MCCOY: There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their
dead. <br>
SEVRIN: Fantasy. Fantasy. <br>
MCCOY: I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last
few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it.
Synthococcus novae. It's deadly. We can immunise against it, but
haven't learned to lick all the problems yet. <br>
KIRK: Does he have it? What about the others? <br>
MCCOY: All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.
Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune, as she was,
but he carries the disease and spreads it to others. <br>
KIRK: Is the crew in danger? <br>
MCCOY: I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before
boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too.
But a regular programme of shots is necessary. I'll have to check
everyone on the ship. There could be some skips. In the meantime, he
should be placed in total isolation. <br>
SEVRIN: This is outrageous. You're not isolating me, you're imprisoning
me. You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me! <br>
MCCOY: Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a
carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? <br>

KIRK: Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on
Doctor Sevrin until further notice. Bones, how long before we know
whether the crew has been endangered by this infection? <br>

you call 'ems the boot out of here. She came in bold as brass, tried to

SPOCK: They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their
sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you
and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine
whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I
can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to
colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present
charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.
The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by
criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred
from Eden. <br>
SEVRIN: As I have been barred. <br>
SPOCK: Then you knew you were a carrier. <br>
SEVRIN: Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the
orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology
because of what my body carries. <br>
SPOCK: What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders. <br>
SEVRIN: Because this is poison to me. This stuff you breathe, this
stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have
layered about every planet. The programs in those computers that run
your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries.
That's what your science have done to me. You've infected me. Only the
primitives can cleanse me. I cannot purge myself until I am among them.
Only their way of living is right. I must go to them. <br>
SPOCK: Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you
know that. <br>
SEVRIN: I shall go to them and be One with them. And together we shall
build a world such as this galaxy has never seen.
A world. A life. A life. So now you're going to try to persuade me that
your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go.

respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done. <br>
SPOCK: His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There
is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like
to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my

back when the galaxy was new. Man found out what he had to do. Found he
had to eat and he found he had to drink. And a long time later he found
he had to think. Uh huh. Yes, think. I'm standing here wondering. <br>
ALL: What? <br>
ADAM: If a man tells another man out of my way. He piles up trouble for
himself all day. But all kinds of trouble come to an end. When a man
tells another man be my friend, uh huh. My friend. Well, what's it
going to be? <br>
GIRL: (singing) There's a mile wide emptiness between you and me. <br>
(Spock arrives with his lyre) <br>
ADAM: Can't reach across it, hardly even see. <br>
GIRL: Someone ought to take a step one way or other. <br>
ADAM: (with chorus) Let's say goodbye, or let's say brother. Brother.
Brother. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out there. Hey, out
there. I see you. I see you. I see you. I see you. Let's get together
and have some fun. I don't know how to do it but it's got to be done. <br>

out the guard. Then he releases Sevrin from his cell)

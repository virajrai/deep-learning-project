light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being Kodos? <br>
LEIGHTON: He is Kodos. I'm sure of it. <br>
KIRK: You said you discovered a new food concentrate. What am I
supposed to put in my log, that you lied? That you diverted a starship
with false information? You're not only in trouble, you've put me in
trouble, too. <br>
LEIGHTON: I did it to trap Kodos! <br>
KIRK: Kodos is dead. <br>
LEIGHTON: Is he? Is anyone sure? A body burned beyond recognition? <br>
KIRK: Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago. <br>
LEIGHTON: Then let's reopen it. Jim, four thousand people were
butchered. <br>
KIRK: Martha, you tell him. <br>
MARTHA: I can't tell him anything, Jim. He's been like this since the
company of actors arrived. <br>
KIRK: Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that. <br>
LEIGHTON: Well, I'm not. I remember him. That voice. The bloody thing
he did. <br>
(He turns his head to reveal it's not just an eyepatch, but a covering
over half his face) <br>
LEIGHTON: Jim, Jim, I need your help. There were only eight or nine of
us who actually saw Kodos. I was one, you were another. If he's to be
exposed, <br>
KIRK: He's dead. <br>
LEIGHTON: Then it will be a ghost Martha and I receive in our home

he's given to fantasy? <br>
SPOCK: A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable,
occasionally brilliant. <br>
KIRK: With a very long memory. <br>

LENORE: My father will be delighted, Mister. Mister? <br>
KIRK: Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise. <br>
LENORE: We are honoured. <br>
KIRK: I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally. <br>
LENORE: I'm sorry, Captain Kirk. He has a rigid rule about that. He
never sees anyone personally, and he never attends parties. <br>
KIRK: An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual. <br>
LENORE: Karidian is a most unusual man. You saw Macbeth. That was my
father. <br>
KIRK: Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth. <br>
(They sit) <br>
LENORE: So. Captain of the Enterprise. Interesting. <br>
KIRK: So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move? <br>
LENORE: We play two performances at Benecia, if the AstraI Queen can
get us there. <br>
KIRK: She's a good ship. (takes a glass from a passing tray) Thank you.
You were very impressive as Lady Macbeth. <br>
LENORE: Thank you. And as Lenore Karidian? <br>
KIRK: Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again. <br>
LENORE: You mean professionally? <br>
KIRK: Not necessarily. <br>
LENORE: I think I'd like that. Unfortunately, we must keep a schedule. <br>
KIRK: You don't have a schedule now, do you? <br>
LENORE: You mean leave? But I've only just arrived. <br>
KIRK; So have I. <br>

very dear, aren't you? In some ways, very lonely. <br>

KIRK: You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it. <br>
LENORE: No, but it's a delightful thought. Captain, I'm afraid we need
your help. We've been stranded. It seems that our transportation has
cancelled out on us. <br>
KIRK: Can't you make other arrangements? <br>
LENORE: Yes, but not in time. You see, our schedule is like a chain.
One break and it all collapses. <br>
KIRK: It'd be a shame if that happened. <br>
LENORE: If ever we needed a Good Samaritan. <br>
KIRK: Well. <br>
LENORE: I appeal to you. <br>

KIRK: The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers. <br>
LENORE: I'll make a bargain with you, Captain. <br>
KIRK: What have you got to trade? <br>
LENORE: Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift. <br>
KIRK: You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol
for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony. <br>
LENORE: Then you'll do it? <br>
KIRK: You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive
me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence. <br>
LENORE: Thank you, Captain. I'm eternally grateful. I'll get the
company ready. This means so much to them. <br>

company is aboard the ship. <br>

acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed. <br>
MCCOY: Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had
time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol. <br>
MCCOY: Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried
about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing. <br>
KIRK: It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard. <br>
MCCOY: Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty
exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you
from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like
the girl? <br>

can look that up

duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible. <br>
LENORE: Star light, star bright. I wish I may, I wish I might. Do you
remember that, Captain? <br>

power, surging and throbbing, yet under control. Are you like that,
Captain? All this power at your command, yet the decisions that you
have to make <br>

you first saw your father act. When was that? <br>

women. <br>

women? <br>
KIRK: Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always
remains a woman. <br>

Cleopatra to worship him. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: I appreciate whatever concern you may have
for the ship's company, Mister Spock, <br>
SPOCK: I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it
started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was
attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over
eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when
Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law. <br>
MCCOY: I've heard of it. <br>
SPOCK: You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the
colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The
remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own
theories of eugenics. <br>
MCCOY: Unfortunately, he wasn't the first. <br>
SPOCK: Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to
decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own
personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy.
Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over
four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died.
Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos?
There never was a positive identification of his body. <br>
MCCOY: What has Karidian to do with it? <br>
SPOCK: His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared. <br>
MCCOY: You think Jim suspects he's Kodos? <br>
SPOCK: He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the
massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was
one of them.
With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness
is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on
Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was
somewhere near when they died. <br>

MCCOY: My report on Lieutenant Riley. <br>
KIRK: Will he make it? <br>
MCCOY: He's got a good chance. <br>
SPOCK: Can we predict the same for you, Captain? <br>
KIRK: All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it. <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you. <br>
KIRK: All right. <br>
SPOCK: Someone tried to kill him. <br>
MCCOY: Could have been an accident. <br>
SPOCK: You should be told the difference between empiricism and
stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you
did. I got the same information. <br>
KIRK: Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My
personal business, <br>
SPOCK: Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth
operation of this ship. <br>
KIRK: You think that happened? <br>
SPOCK: It could happen. <br>
KIRK: I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my
second in command. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, Spock's simply trying, <br>
KIRK: I know what he's doing, and I don't like it. <br>
MCCOY: It's his job, and you know it. <br>
KIRK: And you also know that nothing is proven. <br>
SPOCK: Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals
four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you
invite death? <br>
KIRK: I'm not. I'm interested in justice. <br>
MCCOY: Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance? <br>
KIRK: No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done
before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to
determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos. <br>
SPOCK: He is. <br>
KIRK: You sound certain. I wish I could be. Before I accuse a man of
that, I've got to be. I saw him once, twenty years ago. Men change.
Memory changes. Look at him now, he's an actor. He can change his
appearance. No. Logic is not enough. I've got to feel my way, make
absolutely sure. <br>
MCCOY: What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God,
carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back
the dead, Jim. <br>
KIRK: No, but they may rest easier. <br>
(A scene break, during which McCoy apparently leaves) <br>
SPOCK: Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian
Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley
while the company is on board the Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea
may prove <br>
SPOCK: Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum. <br>
KIRK: A phaser. <br>
SPOCK: On overload. (starts searching) <br>
KIRK: This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters.
If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck. Evacuate all personnel in
this quadrant. Double Red Alert. (now starts searching himself) You get
out of here. <br>
SPOCK: You can't stay. <br>
KIRK: Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear
section C4 and C5. <br>
(In Kirk's quarters the noise gets louder, and finally he sees the
phaser silhouetted against the Red Alert light high in a bulkhead. He
gets it, dashes into the corridor and drops it into a convenient
pressure waste disposal unit directly opposite. Spock returns in time
for the bang that throws them against the opposite wall)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: (barging in without knocking) We're overdue
for our talk, aren't we? <br>
KARIDIAN: I hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain. <br>
KIRK: A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have
destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to
poison one of my crewmen. <br>
KARIDIAN: I am sorry to hear that. <br>
KIRK: I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question. <br>
KARIDIAN: Do you believe that I am? <br>
KIRK: I do. <br>
KARIDIAN: Then I am Kodos, if it pleases you to believe so. I am an
actor. I play many parts. <br>
KIRK: You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago? <br>
KARIDIAN: Younger, Captain. Much younger. <br>
KIRK: So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into
that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a
piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually
infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the
Executioner. (switches on comm.) Ready for voice test. Disguising your
voice will make no difference. <br>
KARIDIAN: (reading) The revolution is successful, but survival depends
on drastic measures. Your continued existence represents a threat to
the well-being of society. (stops looking at the paper) Your lives
means slow death to the more valued members of the colony. Therefore I
have no alternative but to sentence you to death. Your execution is so
ordered. Signed, Kodos, governor of Tarsus Four. <br>
KIRK: I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you
knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper. <br>
KARIDIAN: I learn my parts very quickly. <br>
KIRK: Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front
of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy? <br>
KARIDIAN: I find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate,
Captain. Here you stand, the perfect symbol of our technical society.
Mechanised, electronicised, and not very human. You've done away with
humanity, the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own
resources. <br>
KIRK: We've armed man with tools. The striving for greatness continues.
But Kodos <br>
KARIDIAN: Kodos, whoever he was <br>
KIRK: Or is. <br>
KARIDIAN: Or is. Kodos made a decision of life and death. Some had to
die that others might live. You're a man of decision, Captain. You
ought to understand that. <br>
KIRK: All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly
butchered. <br>
KARIDIAN: In order to save four thousand others. And if the supply
ships hadn't come earlier than expected, this Kodos of yours might have
gone down in history as a great hero. <br>
KIRK: But he didn't. And history has made its judgment. <br>
KARIDIAN: If you're so sure that I'm Kodos, why not kill me now? Let
bloody vengeance take its final course! And see what difference it
makes to this universe of yours. <br>
KIRK: Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing. <br>
KARIDIAN: I suppose not. They're merely tools, like this ship of yours.
<br>
KIRK: There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty
years ago. <br>
KARIDIAN: Blood thins. The body fails. One is finally grateful for a
failing memory. I no longer treasure life, not even my own. I am tired!
And the past is a blank. Did you get everything you, wanted, Captain
Kirk? <br>
KIRK: If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of
this room alive. <br>
LENORE: Captain Kirk. <br>
(She enters from the next room) <br>
LENORE: (to Karidian) You'd better rest now. There's a stain of cruelty
on your shining armour, Captain. You could have spared him, and me. You
talked of using tools. I was a tool, wasn't l? A tool to use against my
father. <br>
KIRK: In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than
that. <br>
LENORE: Later. Everything's always later. Later. Latest. Too late. Too
late, Captain. You are like your ship, powerful, and not human. There
is no mercy in you. <br>
KIRK: If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves.
And if he isn't, then we'll let you off at Benecia, and no harm done.
<br>
LENORE: Captain Kirk. Who are you to say what harm was done? <br>
KIRK: Who do I have to be? </font></p>

stage. Karidian comes backstage.) <br>
LENORE: It's going beautifully. What is it? What's wrong? <br>
KARIDIAN: There was a voice out of the past haunting me, torturing me.
There was another part I once played long ago. I never told you about
it. Now that same curtain rises again. The time has come. <br>
LENORE: No, Father. The time will never come. Tonight, after my
performance, the last two who can harm you will be gone. <br>
KARIDIAN: What are you saying? <br>
LENORE: There were nine. Now there are only two, and they will be gone
as soon as I. Don't look at me like that. <br>

buried them. There's no more blood on your hands. <br>

one thing in my life untouched by what I'd done. <br>

touch you. Not even Captain Kirk. See Caesar come? He's awed by your
greatness, your shining brightness. Bright as a blade before it is
stained with blood. <br>
KIRK: Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you. <br>
LENORE: Of course. After the play. <br>
KIRK: The play is over. It's been over for twenty years. <br>
KARIDIAN: I was a soldier in a cause. There were things to be done,
terrible things. <br>
LENORE: Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify. <br>

my hands ever to stain you. <br>

a world to save him! <br>

takes the shot himself. Lenore screams at what she has done. and
Kirk takes the phaser from her as she kneels over Karidian's body) <br>

eternal cell, that thou, such a prince at a shot so bloodily hast
struck? The curtain, the curtain rises. It rises. There's no time to

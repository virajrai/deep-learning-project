log, stardate 5710.5. Lieutenant Commander Scott reporting. While
exploring an outer quadrant of the galaxy,
the Enterprise received distress calls from an apparently uninhabited,
incredibly beautiful city on the planet of Scalos. Captain Kirk and a
landing party have beamed down to investigate.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A blue background of extraordinary architecture,
and a humanoid statue.) <br>
KIRK: What do your sensors read? <br>
SCOTT [OC]: They register something, sir, but I'm blessed if I can
figure out what it is. <br>
KIRK: Specify. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: I can't get a fix on it. Sensors don't pinpoint a location.
We may have a malfunction. I'm about to check circuits, sir. <br>
KIRK: You do that. Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress
call correspond with this area </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK [OC]: Exactly? <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. I am still receiving visual contact. I can see them,
but I can't see you. <br>
(The viewscreen has five people standing in an area with the same
architecture behind them.) <br>
KIRK [OC]: Check co-ordinates. Is it the same area? <br>
UHURA: Co-ordinates correspond, Captain. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Scalos]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Well, apart from the landing party, there's
no one here. There are no Scalosians. <br>
UHURA [OC]: The distress call is very strong, Captain. They are
pleading for immediate assistance. <br>
KIRK: Check circuits for malfunctions. Kirk out. <br>
MCCOY: It must be a malfunction. This is a barren world. There's hardly
any vegetation, no apparent animal life. <br>
KIRK: When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation. (waves
away a buzz) But there is an insect life. <br>
MCCOY: My tricorder doesn't register it. <br>
KIRK: It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on
the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the
paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated
and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy
while others are apparently long abandoned. <br>
KIRK: No sign of present life? <br>
SPOCK: Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual
and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A
most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further. <br>
KIRK: Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura
is still getting a distress call. What happened? <br>
SPOCK: Unknown at present, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, I want you to run a survey, a complete survey of
the planet using all ship's available instruments. <br>
(McCoy turns to hear a buzz then his assistant disappears.) <br>
MCCOY: Compton! <br>
KIRK: What happened? <br>
MCCOY; I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and he. And he
just wasn't there!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the
distress call. Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. Is Mister Spock still down there? <br>
KIRK: No, he's in Sickbay. Doctor McCoy is running a check on the
landing party. What is it, Lieutenant? <br>
UHURA: Malfunction, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, I would like <br>
UHURA: Captain. It corrected itself. <br>
SULU: Captain, there's some trouble on the hangar deck. The controls
are frozen. <br>
KIRK: Have repair crews been assigned? <br>
SULU: Yes, sir. <br>
UHURA: The tape is ready, sir. <br>
KIRK: Play it. <br>
(Spock enters as the viewscreen displays Scalos and that statue.) <br>
RAEL [on viewscreen]: To any and all space travellers passing within
range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help. My
comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a
thriving civilisation. Those of us who are left
have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what has
been happening to us. Our number is now five.
We were once a nation of nine hundred thousand. <br>
KIRK: Freeze it. <br>
SPOCK: It is logical to assume that this distress call was
pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message. <br>
UHURA: That would explain our continuing to receive it while our
sensors only picked up the landing party, sir. <br>
KIRK: The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find
these people. They were there, now they're not. Nor is Crewman Compton.
<br>
SPOCK: It would seem that some force or agent only partially
discernible to our instruments may have been responsible. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue
the investigation. <br>
SULU: Sir, now I have readings that deflectors are inoperative. The
controls are frozen. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, assist. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a
series of malfunctions. I want an investigation and an explanation. <br>
MCCOY [OC]: McCoy to Captain Kirk. Captain's presence for examination
is requested. <br>
KIRK: Can't it wait, Bones? <br>
MCCOY [OC]: Your orders, Jim. You're the last one. <br>
KIRK: What do you read so far? <br>
MCCOY [OC]: Can we discuss it here? <br>
KIRK: On my way. Mister Spock, you have the conn.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: What is it? <br>
MCCOY: Tell the captain what you told me. <br>
CHAPEL: Something's going on, Captain. Somebody's opened all the
medical supply cabinets. <br>
KIRK: Anything missing? <br>
CHAPEL: Just disordered, as though someone had picked up everything and
examined it. <br>
KIRK: Thank you. <br>
MCCOY: Lie down, Jim. <br>
KIRK: That fits in with other disturbances. Bones, what did your
readings show up on the other men? <br>
MCCOY: All perfectly normal. Whatever happened to Compton down there
apparently had no effect on anyone else. <br>
KIRK: Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming? <br>
MCCOY: No. There's no mention of it. <br>
(The buzzing sound. Kirk starts to sit up.) <br>
MCCOY: I'm not finished yet. <br>
KIRK: Hold on. Bones, could something be making me hallucinate? <br>
MCCOY: What do you mean? <br>
KIRK: I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was
nothing there. And it's just happened again. Could I be imagining it? <br>
MCCOY: Physically, there's nothing wrong with you. <br>
KIRK: But am I hallucinating? <br>
MCCOY: I'd say no. <br>
KIRK: Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the
ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: (bad static) Captain, I have a reading from Life Support
centre <br>
KIRK: Spock, I can't hear you. Check your circuits. Is there a
malfunction? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Captain, intercom system is breaking down rapidly. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, ship wide order. Use communicators instead of
intercom. Issue phasers to all crew members. Spock, repeat. <br>
SPOCK: I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances
being introduced. <br>
KIRK: Meet me there on the double.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spock hands Kirk a phaser. The two security men
running ahead hit a forcefield and fall down.) <br>
KIRK: Spock? <br>
SPOCK: It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not
familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to
those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact
location. <br>
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Sweep the area. <br>
(The corridor goes green as they fire. Then they all walk forward, but
the two security men are stopped again by the force field.) <br>
SPOCK: It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two
of us to enter. I should advise caution. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Environmental Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There is a contraption hooked up to Life Support.)
<br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin. <br>
KIRK: Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it. <br>
SPOCK: Life support is still operating. I would say that the
installation is incomplete. <br>
KIRK: Disconnect it. (Spock gets a shock from it) Destroy it. <br>
(Their phasers disappear from their hands, then they are pushed
backwards.) <br>
KIRK: That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in
here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves! <br>
SPOCK: It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all. <br>
KIRK: A show of strength. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop
them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Have your readings been fed into the
computer? <br>
SPOCK: Affirmative. <br>
KIRK: Read out. <br>
SPOCK: Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded? <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
SPOCK: Nature and description of enemy forces. <br>
COMPUTER: Data insufficient. <br>
SPOCK: Number of enemy forces. <br>
COMPUTER: Data insufficient. <br>
SPOCK: Purpose of the invasion? <br>
COMPUTER: Immediate purpose, seizure and control of Federation Star
ship Enterprise and crew. Data insufficient for determination of end
purpose. <br>
SPOCK: Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance? <br>
COMPUTER: Data insufficient. <br>
SPOCK: Are we at present capable of resisting? <br>
COMPUTER: Negative. <br>
SPOCK: Your recommendation? <br>
COMPUTER: If incapable of resistance, negotiate for terms. <br>
KIRK: We will not negotiate. Do you concur? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Your recommendations, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been
damaged as well? (takes a cup from her tray) My recommendation? Make
them take the next step. <br>
(Kirk hears that buzzing again. We see his coffee bubble briefly. He
takes a drink, grimaces (it is black coffee) then everything around him
slows down and finally stops.) <br>
KIRK: Spock? <br>
DEELA: (the woman from the distress call) Captain. <br>
KIRK: Would you mind explaining (she kisses him) Who are you? <br>
DEELA: Deela. The enemy. <br>
KIRK: You're the enemy? <br>
DEELA: Yes. You beamed me aboard yourself when you came up. A
ridiculously long process, but I've taken care of it. <br>
KIRK: What have you done with my men? <br>
DEELA: Nothing. <br>
KIRK: Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing? <br>
DEELA: There's really nothing wrong with them. They are just as they
have always been. It's you who are different. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. Sulu. This is nothing? <br>
DEELA: They cannot hear you, Captain. To their ears, you sound like an
insect. That's your description, Captain. Accurate, if unflattering.
Really, there is nothing wrong with them. <br>
KIRK: What have you done? <br>
DEELA: Changed you. So you are like me now. Your crew cannot see you or
any of us because of the acceleration. We move in the wink of an eye.
Oh, there is a scientific explanation for it, but all that really
matters is that you can see me and talk to me, and we can go on from
there. <br>
KIRK: Why? <br>
DEELA: Because I like you. Didn't you guess? Or are you so accustomed
to being kissed by invisible women? <br>
(She kisses him again, but he doesn't respond.) <br>
KIRK: Deela. Is this why you sabotaged my ship? <br>
DEELA: Oh, but it has not been sabotaged. We we had to make some
changes in it to adjust it to us. <br>
KIRK: You said we? <br>
DEELA: Yes. Of course. My chief scientist and his crew. I am their
queen. You are going to be their king. You'll enjoy living on Scalos. <br>
KIRK: What about my ship? My crew? <br>
DEELA: Oh, in a few of their moments, they will realise that you've
vanished. They will look for you, but they will not find you. You're
accelerated far beyond their power to see. So they'll go on without
you. Don't be so stubborn. You cannot go back to them, ever. Is it so
dreadful a prospect? <br>
KIRK: (draws his phaser) This won't kill you, but the stun effect is
not very pleasant. <br>
DEELA: But that won't work. You go ahead and try. Point it right at me.
<br>
(She sidesteps the slow phaser beam easily.) <br>
DEELA: My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon. And I am
quite good at self-defense, too. This can be set for stun and destroy,
too, like yours. (his phaser goes flying) Please, accept what has
happened. There is nothing you can do to change it. <br>
KIRK: If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights? Take
out that device in the life-support system? <br>
DEELA: Don't be so silly. You'll feel better about it all in a little
while. It always happens this way. They are very upset at first, then
it wears off and they, they learn to like it. You will, too. <br>
(Kirk leaves} <br>
DEELA: He's on his way to you. Be gentle with him. <br>
(Meanwhile, in our normal time-frame) <br>
UHURA: Captain. Captain Kirk! He's gone! <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant, did you see what happened? <br>
UHURA: Well, he was sitting there. He'd just drunk his coffee and set
his cup down. You see it's still
there. And then he vanished. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, do you verify? <br>
SULU: That's just what happened. He was there, then all of a sudden he
wasn't there.

KIRK: Compton, did they accelerate you? <br>
COMPTON: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: They hooked something into the life support system. They're in
there. We've got to get rid of it. <br>
COMPTON: I'm sorry, sir. Entry is forbidden. <br>
KIRK: By whose order? <br>
COMPTON: The commander, sir. You'll have to step back, please. <br>
KIRK: I'm your commander, Compton. I order you to let me in. <br>
COMPTON: I'm sorry, sir. You are no longer. <br>
KIRK: Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for? <br>
COMPTON: At first I refused, but then after a while I found I couldn't
help myself. I met this girl. She's one of them. I've never known
anyone like her. She brought me aboard to show them operation of the
ship. Bridge controls, life support. She explained that they wanted to
know. I didn't understand at first, but I do now. So will you, sir. <br>
KIRK: All right, Compton. <br>

SCOTT: I had some. <br>
SPOCK: May I? <br>
SCOTT: Was it the coffee? Are we going to go too, just like the
captain? <br>
SPOCK: I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed. <br>
SCOTT: By that time it'll be too late. <br>
SPOCK: I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the
next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine
effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be

Kirk.) <br>
DEELA: I hate what happens to them when they're damaged. You're going
to have to learn to control your temper, Rael. I do not want that to
happen to this one. If they are so stubborn a species, perhaps they
will last longer. <br>
RAEL: It may be. <br>
DEELA: I hope so. They all go so soon. I want to keep this one a long

KIRK: What is that device doing on my ship? <br>
RAEL: Deela will explain it. <br>
DEELA: I will tell you anything you want to know, and you'll approve of
it. <br>
KIRK: Approve of it? We're your prisoners. <br>
DEELA: Hardly. You're free to go anywhere you want to. <br>
RAEL: Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked to your
support system, but it is in operating order. Study it if you wish. I
suggest that you do not touch it. <br>
(Kirk touches the device briefly, then clamps both hands firmly onto it
in an act of defiance. Deela pulls them off.) <br>
DEELA: He told you not to touch it. Look at your hands. They're almost
frozen, aren't they? It will pass. <br>
RAEL: The unit has its own self-defence mechanism, as you see. You
should've heeded me. <br>
(Kirk sees Compton on the floor. The young man now looks very old.) <br>
RAEL: In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged.
Those newly accelerated to our level are sensitive to cell damage. They
age rapidly and die. <br>
KIRK: He was so young. <br>
RAEL: Was. <br>
KIRK: This is what you have planned for us? <br>

RAEL: Perhaps he will be less violent now. <br>
DEELA: I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to. <br>
RAEL: Why do you care what he feels? <br>
DEELA: Rael, he's not one of us. He's temporary. (getting a message via
her collar device) He's gone to the medical laboratory. He's trying to
communicate with the Vulcan. His species is capable of much affection. <br>
RAEL: I have noted that. <br>

sulking. Accept it. We've had to accept it all our lives. Don't make it
worse. <br>

whilst McCoy, Chapel and Spock are motionless at another bench,
examining test results.) <br>

computer banks. <br>

DEELA: Go ahead. You won't accomplish anything, but it may be
historically valuable. <br>
KIRK: Hyperacceleration is the key. I have counted only five of them
aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their
control due to this acceleration. They are able to speed others up to
their level, as they did Compton and me. Presumably, this is
enslavement? Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming
docile eventually. But when <br>
DEELA: Damaged. <br>
KIRK: Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living <br>
DEELA: Burns them out. <br>
KIRK: Burns them out. Compton was burned out. The device attached to
the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my
belief
that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for
purposes only the Scalosians know. <br>
DEELA: Quite correct. <br>
KIRK: The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any
physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction
is imperative. <br>
DEELA: The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will
be too late. You have remarkable reasoning powers, Captain. You were
quite right in almost every assumption. <br>
KIRK: Why are you doing this? <br>
DEELA: Do you really want to know? In a little while it won't matter to
you at all. You'll be quite happy about it, Just as Compton was. <br>
KIRK: I really want to know. <br>
DEELA: Oh, dear. You are so stubborn. It should be obvious to you that
we're doing it because we have to. A long time ago, it is in our
history, we used to be like you. Then our country was almost destroyed
by volcanic eruptions. The water was polluted. Radiation was released.
That changed us. It accelerated us. The children died. Most of the
women found they could not have more. All of our men had become
sterile. So we had to mate outside our own people. Whenever a spaceship
came by, we'd send our calls for help. But accelerating them to our
level burned them out. Don't you see, Captain? Do I have to go into
every detail? We are going to take you down with us. Perhaps one or two
others of your crew. We have to. We'll be kind to you. I wouldn't hurt
you, certainly. I do like you. <br>
KIRK: What about the rest of my crew? <br>
DEELA: They'll remain here in suspended animation. It will do them no
harm. We are saving them for when we need them in the future. You will
not last forever. You know that, Captain. Captain, we have the right to
survive. <br>
KIRK: Not by killing others. <br>
DEELA: You were doing exactly the same thing. You came charging into
that life-support room the minute you knew there was trouble. You would
have killed every one my people if you could have. <br>
KIRK: You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew. <br>
DEELA: There is no difference. <br>
KIRK: There is a difference! Your trouble is in you. <br>
DEELA: We did not ask for it. We are not to blame. We are handling it
the only way we know how. The way our parents and their parents before
them. <br>
KIRK: Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela,
have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit.
I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you. We'll move
you to another planet. We'll call on the most brilliant minds in our
Federation to help. We'll do it<br>
DEELA: We have tried other ways. We've tried to make the transition to
your level. Some of us, that is. Those who made the attempt died. We
are trapped, Captain, Just as you are trapped now. I'm sorry for what's
going to happen to you, but I cannot change it. You cannot change me. <br>
RAEL [OC]: Go to the transporter room, Deela. Signal me when you're
there and beam down. <br>
DEELA: With the captain? <br>
RAEL [OC]: Yes. I'll activate our unit and follow you. I'm setting it
to allow all of us time to get off the ship. Please don't delay. <br>

at this. The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the
Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups.

KIRK: I panicked. <br>

KIRK: I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation

RAEL [OC]: Beam him down at once. <br>
DEELA: Captain. <br>

nothing happens.) <br>

it is, Captain? <br>

DEELA: The captain says his technicians <br>
RAEL [OC]: I heard him. You expect me to believe him? <br>
DEELA: I expect you to check into all possible causes. If I had a
suspicious nature, Captain, I would say that you sabotaged the
transporter to buy time. <br>
KIRK: Yes, of course. <br>

Austere and efficient, and in their own way, handsome. <br>
KIRK: A room should reflect its occupant. <br>
DEELA: Absolutely. May I freshen up? All this rushing about has left me
windblown. I'm glad to see you allow yourself some comforts. Are you
married, Captain? No family? No attachments? I know. You're married to
your career, and you never look at another woman. <br>
KIRK: Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look. <br>
DEELA: I wondered when you'd say something nice to me. Am I more
presentable now? <br>
KIRK: A bit. <br>
DEELA: It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me.
But now <br>
KIRK: But now. <br>
(He kisses her, then takes her hands but she dodges away. He was trying
to get the weapon from her sleeve.) <br>
DEELA: No. I wouldn't allow you to take that no matter how much we
trust each other. But I would've been disappointed if you hadn't tried.
<br>
KIRK: Was I too crude? <br>
DEELA: Just don't try it again. You're far too vulnerable to skin
damage. All I have to do is scratch you. <br>

down the playback, then speeds it up) Those of us who are left have

that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze. The
unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I
don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. <br>
DEELA [OC]: The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it
will be too late. <br>
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force
field and get at that unit? <br>
SPOCK: Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level. <br>
SCOTT: Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs? <br>

RAEL: Then don't torment me. You know how I feel. <br>
DEELA: I don't care what your feelings are. I don't want to know that
aspect of it. What I do is necessary, and you have no right to question
it. Allow me the dignity of liking the man I select. Is the transporter
repaired? <br>

You even like it. <br>

DEELA: No! I liked you better before. Stubborn and irritating and
independent, like Rael. <br>
KIRK: Those are undesirable qualities. <br>

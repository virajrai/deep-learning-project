young female Yeoman is getting a signature from the Captain.) <br>
KIRK: Anything from the landing party? <br>
SPOCK: They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain. (Kirk
stretches and groans) Something wrong?<br>
KIRK: A kink in my back. (behind his back the Yeoman starts to massage
it) That's it. A little higher, please. Push. Push hard. Dig it in
there, Mister <br>
(Spock steps forward and Kirk realises who is massaging his lower back)
<br>
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. That's sufficient.<br>
TONIA: You need sleep, Captain. If it's not out of line<br>
KIRK: I have enough of that from Doctor McCoy, Yeoman. Thank you.<br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been
through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is
not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course.<br>
KIRK: Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant.<br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, Captain.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SULU: Beautiful, beautiful. No animals, no people,
no worries. Just what the doctor ordered. Right, Doctor?<br>
MCCOY: I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.<br>
SULU: Do you think the Captain will authorise shore leave here?<br>
MCCOY: Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.
You know, you have to see this place to believe it. It's like something
out of Alice in Wonderland. The Captain has to come down.<br>
SULU: He'd like it.<br>
MCCOY: He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got
ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's. Where are
you going?<br>
SULU: To get some cell-structure records. A blade of grass, a bush, a
tree, a flower petal. With these, we can tell the whole planet's
biology.<br>
(As Sulu crouches down behind some pampas grass, McCoy turns and looks
straight at a white rabbit in a check jacket, yellow waistcoat, and
looking at a gold pocket-watch.)<br>
RABBIT: Oh, my paws and whiskers! I'll be late. <br>
(It heads off down a hole. Then a young girl comes running up, wearing
a blue dress with a white apron.)<br>
ALICE: Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a rather large white rabbit with a
yellow waistcoat and white gloves here about?<br>
(Wordlessly, McCoy points in the direction the rabbit went. The girl
curtseys nicely) <br>
ALICE: Thank you very much. <br>
(She runs off after the rabbit) <br>
MCCOY: Sulu!<br>
SULU: What is it? What's the matter?<br>
MCCOY: Did you see them?<br>
SULU: See what? I don't see anything. What is it, Doc? </font></p>

of Yeoman Tonia Barrows) <br>
KIRK: Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an
uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably
like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful,
green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good
to be true. <br>
TONIA: Sir, I don't see your name in any of the shore parties.<br>
KIRK: I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed.<br>
TONIA: Aye, aye, sir.<br>
(She leaves, and Spock enters) <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first.
Which section would you like to go with?<br>
SPOCK: Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to
rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and
down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.<br>
(Intercom whistles) <br>
KIRK: Kirk here.<br>
UHURA [OC]: Doctor McCoy calling from the planet, Captain.<br>
KIRK: Yes. Open a channel, Uhura.<br>

a hedge.<br>
KIRK: All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration.
Captain out. That's a McCoy pill, with a little mystery sugar-coating.
He wants to get me down there. I'm afraid I won't swallow it.<br>
SPOCK: Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss.<br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?<br>
SPOCK: I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember
aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down
nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three.<br>
KIRK: That's much too low a rating. <br>
SPOCK: He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take
rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found <br>
KIRK: A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That
man will go a shore on my orders. What's his name?<br>
SPOCK: James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet.
You'll find it quite pleasant. Very much like your Earth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An establishing shot of a landscape) <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields
of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no
problems.<br>
(But as these words are spoken, a rock raises itself to reveal a
classic western-style six shooter gun.) <br>
(Elsewhere, a man and a woman are taking scans of the vegetation) <br>
TELLER: (the woman) Does it always have to be work with you? There's so
much loveliness. <br>
RODRIGUEZ: You won't find all this so lovely if our report for the
Captain isn't ready when he asks for it, which shouldn't be long.<br>
(Kirk and Barrows beam down) <br>
KIRK: Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?<br>
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, sir. We've completed the specimen survey.<br>
KIRK: Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when
you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves.<br>
RODRIGUEZ: Thank you, sir. And sir, I think you'll find Doctor McCoy
and Mister Sulu that way.<br>
KIRK: Thank you.<br>
(Walking along) <br>
KIRK: Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a
place this beautiful exists. <br>
TONIA: It is beautiful. So lovely, and restful. I mean, affirmative,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: McCoy! McCoy! <br>
MCCOY: Over here. Over here.<br>
(They meet up by the lake) <br>
KIRK: Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?<br>
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at
this. (a pair of large tracks in the soil) I saw what I saw, or maybe I
hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you
think about it. <br>
KIRK: Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual
creature to make this size tracks. What about Mister Sulu? Will he
confirm what you saw?<br>
MCCOY: Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.<br>
KIRK: Bridge, this is the Captain.<br>
TONIA: Where is Mister Sulu?<br>
MCCOY: Collecting specimens.<br>
UHURA [OC]: Bridge.<br>
KIRK: Has the first shore party beamed down yet?<br>
UHURA: Negative, Captain. They're just about to start.<br>
KIRK: Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to
leave the ship.<br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.<br>
MCCOY: You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim? <br>
KIRK: You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this?<br>
MCCOY: Well, no. <br>
KIRK: Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is
harmless. But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's
harmless.<br>
(They hear a gunshot. Kirk draws his phaser and they head off in the
direction of the shot. More are fired.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They find Sulu target practising) <br>
KIRK: What do you think you're doing?<br>
SULU: Target shooting, Captain. Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything
like this in my collection.<br>
KIRK: Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?<br>
SULU: I found it. I know it's a crazy coincidence, but I've always
wanted one like this. Found it lying right over there. An old-time
police special, and in beautiful condition. Hasn't been one like this
made in a couple of centuries.<br>
KIRK: (holding out his hand for the offending weapon) Mister Sulu.<br>
SULU: (handing it over) It fires lead pellets propelled by expanding
gases from a chemical explosion.<br>
KIRK: I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you
trigger-happy.<br>
TONIA: Doctor McCoy's rabbit, sir. He must have gone through here.<br>
KIRK: Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this
planet?<br>
MCCOY: Absolutely. No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing. I'm
certain our readings weren't off.<br>
KIRK: I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman
Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu. Find out where those tracks came
from. Doctor, you come with me back to the glade. I'd like another look
at that area. <br>
(As they head back, an aerial comes up in front of our point of view
and follows them.) <br>
KIRK: This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.<br>
MCCOY: Well, it could have been worse.<br>
KIRK: How?<br>
MCCOY: You could have seen the rabbit.<br>
KIRK: What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?<br>
MCCOY: Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if
that's what you mean. <br>
KIRK: I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper
classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My
own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan.<br>
MCCOY: And you being the very serious young <br>
KIRK: Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim,
which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of
cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door.
You never knew where he'd strike next. More tracks. Looks like your
rabbit came from over there.<br>
MCCOY: A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.<br>
KIRK: Yes. You follow the rabbit. I'll backtrack the girl. I'll meet
you around the other side of the hill.<br>
MCCOY: Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim. <br>
(They split up, and then suddenly there's a young man leaning against a
tree trunk) <br>
FINNEGAN: (in a dreadful cod-Irish accent) Jim.<br>
KIRK: Finnegan? I can't believe it. <br>
FINNEGAN: You never know when I'm going to strike, huh, Jim? (hits him
on the jaw) How's this? Come on, come on. It's me, Finnegan. All right,
Jimmy boy. (maniacal laughter) Go ahead, lay one on me. That's what you
always wanted, isn't it? Come on. Come on. <br>
KIRK: All right, let's try that one again. Go! <br>
(He just lays hands on Finnegan for a good fight, when they hear
screams. Kirk runs off to investigate) <br>
FINNEGAN: Go! Any excuse, Jim baby. Run away! Run away! Run away! <br>
(Along the path, he meets McCoy) <br>
MCCOY: What was it?<br>
KIRK: Yeoman Barrows. <br>
(They arrive on the scene to find Tonia disheveled, her uniform torn,
hugging a tree) <br>
KIRK: What happened?<br>
TONIA: I don't know. I mean I do know. I was following the tracks, and
there he was.<br>
KIRK: Who was?<br>
TONIA: Him.<br>
KIRK: Barrows, give me a report.<br>
TONIA: He had a cloak, sir, and a dagger with jewels on it.<br>
KIRK: Are you sure you're not imagining all this?<br>
TONIA: Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it
any more than I imagined he did this.<br>
MCCOY: Sounds like Don Juan.<br>
TONIA: Yes. Yes. It was so sort of story book walking around here, and
I was thinking, all a girl needs is Don Juan. Just day dreaming, the
way you would about someone you'd like to meet.<br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?<br>
TONIA: He ran after him.<br>
KIRK: Stay with her, Doctor.<br>
(He heads off in the direction she indicates) <br>

of them.<br>

RODRIQUEZ [OC]: I like them fine, sir, but all our surveys showed<br>
KIRK; Then offhand I'd say our instruments are defective. There are
indeed life-forms on this planet.<br>

might be able to transport one more person.<br>
KIRK: Good. We can use your help.<br>
SULU: We're stranded down here, Captain?<br>
KIRK: Until we can find out what this is all about. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TONIA: There's no one here.<br>
MCCOY: This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. (makes Tonia stand
with her back to a tree) I swear I heard someone moving around.<br>
TONIA: Don't talk like that. <br>
MCCOY: A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to
protect her.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A knight in armour on a black horse has appeared,
and is coming towards them.) <br>
MCCOY: These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go
back to where you were. <br>
(Kirk and Spock arrive on the scene. The knight lowers his lance,
charges, and runs McCoy through. Tonia screams. Spock draws his phaser,
and Kirk the gun he confiscated from Sulu. He shoots the knight from
his horse, then they run to McCoy.) <br>
TONIA: He's dead.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. All contact with the
Enterprise has been lost. We're trapped here. Our ship's surgeon, my
personal friend, is dead. We're certain now that whatever we're facing
is terribly real.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TONIA: It's my fault. It never would have happened.
It's my fault. <br>
KIRK: No. <br>
TONIA: It is, it is. I'm to blame.<br>
KIRK: Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.<br>
TONIA: Aye, aye, sir.<br>
SULU: (at the knight's body) Captain! Captain!<br>
(Kirk goes over) <br>
SULU: You'd better have a look at this, sir. (the knight is a plastic
dummy) I don't understand.<br>
KIRK: Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I
will.<br>
SULU: It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive.<br>
KIRK: Tricorder?<br>
SULU: Still operating, sir.<br>
KIRK: Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the
tricorder) What do you make of that?<br>
SPOCK: This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely
resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of
course.<br>
KIRK: I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock.<br>
SPOCK: This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same
basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.<br>
KIRK: Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?<br>
SPOCK: I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The
plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured.<br>
KIRK: By who? And why? And why these particular things?<br>
SPOCK: All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real
thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TELLER: What is it?<br>
RODRIGUEZ: Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was telling you a
while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used?
That's one of them.<br>
TELLER: Can it hurt us?<br>
RODRIGUEZ: Not unless it makes a strafing run.<br>
TELLER: A what?<br>
RODRIGUEZ: The way they used to attack people on the ground. (the plane
descends) Come on.<br>
(They run along the path, as a second plane joins the first, straight
into a clump of trees. Angela falls to the ground having hit the tree.)
<br>

notices...) <br>
SULU: Captain!<br>
KIRK: McCoy's body? <br>
SULU: He's gone. Dragged off. <br>
TONIA: The black knight, too.<br>
KIRK: Spock?<br>
SPOCK: At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very
scientific. <br>
KIRK: McCoy's death is a scientific fact. <br>
SPOCK: There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless.
Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people
you described? <br>
KIRK: I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days <br>
FINNEGAN: Hey, Jim baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!
Well, I'm waiting for you, Jimmy boy.<br>
KIRK: Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?<br>
(Finnegan laughs and runs off) <br>
KIRK: Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.<br>
SPOCK: Captain, wait.<br>
KIRK: That's an order, Mister Spock.<br>
(He runs off after Finnegan) <br>
FINNEGAN: Here I am! Run! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocky outcrop]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FINNEGAN: Jim! Find me! Can't you see me? Come and
get me! Here I am! Come on. You never could find your head with both
hands! Like it used to be, Jimmy. Remember? (finally Kirk catches up to
him, because he's lounging on a ledge) Hey, Jim <br>
KIRK: I want some answers.<br>
FINNEGAN: Coming up. <br>
(He jumps on Kirk and they have a fight. Finnegan knocks Kirk down) <br>
FINNEGAN: Get up. Get up. Get up. Always fight fair, don't you? True
officer and gentleman, you. You stupid underclassman. I've got the
edge. I'm still twenty years old. Look at you. You're an old man.<br>
(The fight resumes, and Kirk punches Finnegan till he falls down a
rocky slope and ends up writhing in pain) <br>
FINNEGAN: I can't move me leg. I can't feel me leg. My back is broken.
You've broken me back. <br>
KIRK: Can you feel that? <br>
(He gets kicked to the ground) <br>
FINNEGAN: Can you feel that, now? (Kirk passes out) Sleep sweet, Jimmy
boy. Sleep as long as you like. Sleep forever, Jim boy. Forever and
forever. <br>
(A little later, Kirk regains consciousness) <br>
FINNEGAN: Won't you ever learn, Jim boy? You never could take me, you
know.<br>
KIRK: Finnegan. One thing<br>
FINNEGAN: Sure. Name it.<br>
KIRK: Answers.<br>
FINNEGAN: Earn them! <br>
(He throws dirt in Kirk's face and the exchange of punches resumes
until they're both too tired to continue.) <br>
FINNEGAN: Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?<br>
KIRK: A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?<br>
FINNEGAN: I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy.<br>
KIRK: I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you
doing here?<br>
FINNEGAN: I'm being exactly what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy.<br>
(Kirk lands the final haymaker that knocks Finnegan out cold) <br>
SPOCK: Did you enjoy it, Captain?<br>
KIRK: Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years. (realisation dawns) I
did enjoy it. The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to
beat the tar out of Finnegan.<br>
SPOCK: Which supports a theory I've been formulating. <br>
KIRK: That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be
thinking about at the moment.<br>
SPOCK: Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly
manufactured and provided for us.<br>
KIRK: Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about <br>
SPOCK: Yes. We must all control our thoughts. <br>
KIRK: Difficult. <br>
SPOCK: The force field we encountered is obviously underground,
manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for
example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger <br>
KIRK: Spock. <br>
(The tiger is behind them, the chain around it's neck tethering it to
the spot clearly visible) <br>
KIRK: We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them. <br>
(They start to run back to the glade. The aircraft strafe them, Kirk
elbows the Samurai out of his way) </font></p>

SULU: Sir. <br>
KIRK: Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk.
Don't breathe. Don't think. You're at attention. Concentrate on that
and only that. Concentrate.<br>
SPOCK: Captain.<br>
(A smiling grey-haired man in a long green robe walks up to Kirk) <br>
KIRK: Who are you?<br>
CARETAKER: I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk.<br>
KIRK: You know my name?<br>
CARETAKER: But of course. Lieutenant Rodriguez, Lieutenant Sulu, Yeoman
Barrows and Mister Spock. We've just discovered you don't understand
all this. These experiences were intended to amuse you.<br>
KIRK: Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?<br>
CARETAKER: But none of this is permanent. Here you have to only imagine
your fondest wishes, either old ones you wish to relive or new ones,
anything at all. Battle, fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases you
can be made to happen.<br>
SPOCK: The term is amusement park.<br>
CARETAKER: Of course.<br>
SPOCK: An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and
do all sorts of fascinating things. <br>
CARETAKER: This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to
come and play.<br>
SULU: Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play?<br>
KIRK: Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater
the need for the simplicity of play.<br>
CARETAKER: Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you.<br>
KIRK: But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.<br>
MCCOY: Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely
girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather
remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down
there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately.<br>
TONIA: (not amused) And how do you explain them?<br>
MCCOY: Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I
know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus
line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave.<br>
TONIA: And so am l.<br>
MCCOY: Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn
something up.<br>
(The cabaret girls go to Sulu and Spock.) <br>
CARETAKER: We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable.<br>
KIRK: You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are
you from?<br>
CARETAKER: My impression is that your race is not yet ready to
understand us, Captain.<br>
SPOCK: I tend to agree.<br>
(a communicator beeps) <br>
KIRK: Kirk here.<br>
UHURA [OC]: This is the bridge, Captain. Our power systems have just
come back in. Do you require assistance?<br>
KIRK: No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by.<br>
CARETAKER: However. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Aye, aye, sir.<br>
CARETAKER: If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet
of ours could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves, if
you wish.<br>
MCCOY: It's what the doctor ordered, Jim.<br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Sir?<br>
KIRK: Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare
for the best shore leave they've ever had. Kirk out.<br>
SPOCK: (handing the girl over to Sulu) Captain, I'll go back aboard
ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've
already had as much shore leave as I care for.<br>
KIRK: No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. (then he sees Ruth walking
towards the group) On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two. </font></p>

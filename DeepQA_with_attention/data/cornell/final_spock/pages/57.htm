Captain's Log: Stardate 4372.5. On a top-secret diplomatic mission, the
Enterprise has entered the Tellun star system.
Maintaining communications blackout, we have taken aboard Petri,
Ambassador from Troyius, the outer planet, and are now approaching the
inner planet Elas.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut
these cloak-and-dagger orders. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, but why the secrecy? This star system's under Federation
control. <br>
SPOCK: It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim
jurisdiction. <br>
SCOTT: From what I've seen, it's not worth fighting about. Why are we
here, Captain? <br>
KIRK: My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters
pertaining to his mission here. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Scotty. (Scott presses the intercom button) Kirk here. What is
it? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Captain, I have a signal from the Elasians. They're ready
to beam aboard, and they demand an explanation for the delay. <br>
KIRK: Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard. <br>
SPOCK: Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the
initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant. <br>
MCCOY: That's just the negative part, Mister Spock. I've been over
those records. Now the women, they're supposed to be something very
special. They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that
drives men wild. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Ambassador is a skinny humanoid with orange
hair and grass green skin.) <br>
KIRK: Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me
what this is about? <br>
PETRI: That must wait until the Dohlman is aboard. <br>
KIRK: Dohlman? What the devil is a Dohlman? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Transporter room]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PETRI: The thing most feared and hated by my
people. Our most deadly enemy. <br>
(Three burly men are beamed aboard. They draw their weapons.) <br>
PETRI: Welcome. I am Petri, Ambassador of Troyius. <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. This ship is under my command. <br>
KRYTON: There's a Troyian here. I must know that all is secure before
the Dohlman is brought on board. <br>
KIRK: This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts.
Energise. <br>
(The Elasians get down on one knee.) <br>
KRYTON: Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas. <br>
(Petri kneels) <br>
KRYTON: Glory to Elaan, Dohlman of Elas. <br>
(A woman in little more than a high-necked bathing suit is beamed
aboard. She is beautiful, but slightly sullen. The Enterprise officers
kneel.) <br>
KRYTON: You may stand. <br>
KIRK: Body armour, nuclear weapons. <br>
SPOCK: Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that <br>
KRYTON: Permission to speak was not given. <br>
ELAAN: You rule this ship? <br>
SPOCK: I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk. <br>
PETRI: Your Glory, I am Petri. In the name of my people <br>
ELAAN: Your mission is known to us. Captain Kirk, you have now
permission to show us to our quarters. <br>
KIRK: Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind
of understanding. <br>
PETRI: Please. <br>
KIRK: My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters.
Ambassador, I'd like to speak to you. <br>
ELAAN: You have not been dismissed. <br>
KIRK: May I have your permission to go? <br>
ELAAN: You are now dismissed. <br>
KIRK: Why, thank you. Ambassador. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Ambassador, I think it's time you told me
what's going on. <br>
PETRI: That creature, Elaan, is to be the wife of our ruler to bring
peace. Our two warring planets now possess the capability
of mutual destruction. Some method of co-existence must be found. <br>
KIRK: I see. So, we go back to Troyius. <br>
PETRI: Yes. But slowly, Captain. I will need time. Before we reach
there, she must be taught civilised manners. In her present condition,
my people would never accept her. <br>
KIRK: And you are to be her teacher? <br>
PETRI: Those are my orders. I must ask you and your crew to respect, or
at least tolerate, their arrogance. Friction must be kept at a minimum.
<br>
KIRK: Yes, that I can understand. <br>
PETRI: Another thing you should understand, Captain. You have as much
at stake as I have. Your superiors made the statement that failure of
this mission would be as catastrophic for Federation planning as it
would be for our two planets. To gain peace at the price of accepting
such a queen is no victory. I will take her the official gifts I bear.
Perhaps that will soften her mood. </font></p>

Mister Sulu, impulse drive, speed factor point zero three seven. <br>
SULU: Impulse drive, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero
three seven.<br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Captain? You'll not be using the warp drive? All the way on
impulse? That'll take a great deal of time. <br>
KIRK: You in a hurry, Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: No. <br>
(Spock enters.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided.
<br>
UHURA: What's the matter with them, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational. <br>
UHURA: I gave up my quarters because I <br>
KIRK: Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura. I'll talk to
her myself.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Elaan is throwing slippers at Petri.) <br>
ELAAN: Swine! Take back your gifts! <br>
PETRI: Your Glory, these are your wedding slippers. <br>
ELAAN: Your ruler cannot buy the favours of the Dohlman of Elas. <br>
PETRI: This, (a sky blue thing) this is your wedding dress, a gift from
the bridegroom's mother. <br>
ELAAN: I want nothing of his! <br>
PETRI: This, This is the most prized of royal jewels for your lovely
neck. <br>
(Kirk enters.) <br>
ELAAN: I would strangle if I was to put the gift of a Troyian dog
around my neck. Kryton, by whose permission did he enter? <br>
KRYTON: He came in answer to your summons. <br>
KIRK: I understand you're not happy with your quarters. <br>
ELAAN: Quarters! (throws something that breaks) <br>
KIRK: Yes, not happy at all. <br>
ELAAN: Am I a soft Troyian fawn to need pillows to sit on? And these
ridiculous female trappings. They are an offense to my eyes. <br>
KIRK: My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you
would find it satisfactory. <br>
ELAAN: I do not find them so, and I find him even less satisfactory.
Must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador aboard
your ship? <br>
PETRI: I explained to Her Glory that her council of nobles and the
Troyius Tribunal jointly agreed that I should instruct (pause) make her
acquainted with the customs and manners of our people. <br>
ELAAN: Kryton! Remove him! And take that garbage with you? <br>
(Petri picks up the wedding dress and necklace box, and leaves with
Kryton.) <br>
ELAAN: He dares to suggest that I adopt the servile manners of his
people! <br>
KIRK: Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction. <br>
ELAAN: I will never forgive the council for putting me through this
torture. Were you responding to my demand for better quarters? <br>
KIRK: There are none better. I suggest you make do with these. <br>
ELAAN: You suggest? <br>
KIRK: There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can
get gratification, I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from
floor to ceiling with breakable objects. <br>
ELAAN: I will not be humiliated! <br>
KIRK: Then act in a civilised fashion. <br>
ELAAN: I did not give you permission to leave! <br>
KIRK: I didn't ask for any.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PETRI: Captain, I wish to contact my government. I
cannot fulfil my mission. It would be an insult to our ruler to bring
this incorrigible monster as a bride! <br>
KIRK: Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission. <br>
PETRI: There cannot be peace between us. We have deluded ourselves.
Captain, when I am near them, I do not want peace. I want to kill them.
<br>
KIRK: You're as bad as she is. It's not required that you like each
other. Just do your job. <br>
PETRI: Job? The job is impossible. We cannot make peace with people we
detest. <br>
KIRK: Stop trying to kill each other. Then worry about being friendly. <br>
PETRI: But if she won't listen to me <br>
KIRK: Then make her listen, Ambassador. Use a different approach. Stop
being so diplomatic. She respects strength. Go in strong.

appears intermittently. <br>

drives it. Engines are for mechanics and menials. <br>

KIRK: Mister Scott! I wish you had told me you wanted a tour of the

want? <br>

Engineer, has shown you his engineering department. That's a courtesy.

UHURA: Captain Kirk. May I speak with you, sir? <br>
KIRK: Yes. Certainly. <br>
UHURA: A message just came from Starfleet Command. It was class-A
security and scrambled. I put it through the decoder. <br>
KIRK: What was it? <br>
UHURA: The Federation High Commissioner is on his way to Troyius to
attend the royal wedding. <br>
CHAPEL: Ambassador, if Elasian women are that vicious, why are men so
overwhelmingly attracted to them? I mean, what magic do they possess? <br>
PETRI: It's not magic. It's biochemical. A man whose flesh is once
touched by the tears of a woman of Elas has his heart enslaved forever.
<br>
KIRK: Ambassador, there's an added complication. The Federation High
Commissioner will be attending the wedding. <br>
MCCOY: The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried
to murder the groom's ambassador. <br>
PETRI: There will be no wedding. I would not have our ruler marry that
monster if the entire galaxy depended on it, and I will have nothing
further to do with you. <br>

KIRK: Nothing would please me more, Your Glory. But your impetuous
nature <br>
ELAAN: Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission,
so I stabbed him. Just to be Troyian is enough. <br>
KIRK: You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must
understand discipline to be able to give and take orders. My orders are
to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian
customs. <br>
ELAAN: I despise Troyians. Any contact with them makes me feel soiled. <br>
KIRK: It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about
each other disappear when they get to know each other. <br>
ELAAN: It's not in my experience. <br>
KIRK: Well, we're still faced with the same problem. <br>
ELAAN: Problem? <br>
KIRK: Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and
manners. <br>
ELAAN: I have eliminated that problem. <br>
KIRK: You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains. <br>
ELAAN: Oh. And how do we solve the problem? <br>
KIRK: By giving you a new teacher. <br>
ELAAN: Tell me, what can you teach me? <br>
KIRK: Table manners, for one thing. This is a plate. It contains food.
This is a knife. It cuts the food. This is a glass. <br>
ELAAN: Leave me! <br>
KIRK: Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to
learn. <br>
ELAAN: You will return me to Elas immediately. <br>
KIRK: That's impossible. <br>
ELAAN: Everything I order is possible. <br>
KIRK: That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get
you ready to go to Troyius. <br>
ELAAN: I will not go to Troyius, I will not be mated to a Troyian, and
I will not be humiliated, and I will not be given to a green pig as a
bribe to stop a war! <br>
KIRK: You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman.
Then be worthy of them. If you don't want the obligations that go along
with the title, then give it up. <br>
ELAAN: Nobody speaks to me that way. <br>
KIRK: That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that
you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an
arrogant monster! <br>

and wanted to marry me. He was furious when he heard of the
announcement of the wedding plans. <br>
KIRK: He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy? <br>
ELAAN: Probably. But why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak
about us? <br>
KIRK: There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement?
Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage. <br>
ELAAN: We should welcome their help. <br>
KIRK: Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability
depends on it. We have a duty to forget what happened. <br>
ELAAN: Could you do that? Could you give me to another man? <br>
KIRK: My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What
happened, what happened was an accident. <br>
ELAAN: It was no accident. I chose you, and you chose me. I have a
plan. With this ship, you could completely obliterate Troyius. Then
there will be no need for the marriage. And in gratitude, my people
will give you the complete rule of this system. <br>
KIRK: What kind of a mind could think of such a thing? <br>
ELAAN: He's a Troyian. <br>

MCCOY: Did she cry, Jim? <br>
KIRK: What? <br>
MCCOY: Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time? <br>
(Kirk looks at his hand.) <br>
MCCOY: Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that
the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears
that acts like a super love potion. And according to him, it doesn't
wear off. <br>
SPOCK: It is true then, Captain? <br>
KIRK: It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote. <br>
MCCOY: I'll try, but I'll need tests and <br>

KIRK: Captain here. <br>
SULU [OC]: Captain, the Klingon ship has changed course. It is heading
toward us at warp speed. <br>

KIRK: Hold your fire. <br>
SULU: She's passed us without firing a shot. <br>
SPOCK: I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate
this time. <br>
KIRK: Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were
trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves
up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the
Federation. Very neat. <br>
SPOCK: Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this
system so vital? <br>
KIRK: Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong
place for the Dohlman at a time like this? <br>
KIRK: I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister
Spock. (to Elaan) I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected
part of the ship. <br>

gladly do that. <br>

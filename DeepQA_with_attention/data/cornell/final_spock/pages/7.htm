TORMOLEN: Well, better look for yourself, Mister Spock. One man was
taking a shower fully clothed. (they split up, he takes off his glove
to scratch his nose then puts it on the console. Something orange jumps
onto his skin. Feeling the cold he puts the glove back on)<br>
SPOCK: Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you
read, Enterprise? <br>
KIRK [OC]: Kirk, affirmative.<br>

SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's Log: Stardate 1704.2. The science party
we were to have picked up has been found dead. Life support systems had

unusual. Meanwhile, we remain in orbit to complete our mission, close
scientific measurement of the break-up of this planet.

Mister Spock? Your pulse is two hundred and forty two, your blood
pressure is practically nonexistent, assuming you call that green stuff
in your veins blood.<br>

as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.<br>
KIRK: How are they?<br>
MCCOY: They're fine, Jim. <br>
TORMOLEN: Terrible, Captain. It was terrible. They were just sitting,
like they didn't care. Whatever was happening, they didn't care. I keep
wondering<br>
KIRK: You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep
wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of
what happened down there?<br>
SPOCK: I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite
bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.<br>
TORMOLEN: Six dead. Six people dead.<br>

RAND: Spectro-analysis tape, sir.<br>
SPOCK: Thank you.<br>
KIRK: Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer
sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A
crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.<br>
SPOCK: He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.<br>
KIRK: And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image
wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?<br>
MCCOY: Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the
tapes prove that conclusively.<br>
SPOCK: It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but
it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no
contamination, no unusual elements present.<br>
SCOTT: Or at least none your tricorders could register.<br>
SPOCK: Instruments register only those things they're designed to
register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.<br>
KIRK: Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the
breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise
in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there
to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?<br>
SPOCK: We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit.
When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity,
mass, magnetic field.<br>
KIRK: The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based
on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time
for surprise. <br>
SCOTT: Unless you people on the Bridge start taking showers with your
clothes on, my engines can pull us out of anything. We'll be warping
out of orbit within a half second of getting your command.<br>
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.<br>
KIRK: Kirk here.<br>
UHURA [OC]: Scanners report sudden four degree shift in planet magnetic
field. A change in mass also, sir.<br>
SPOCK: It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.<br>
KIRK: On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second,
Scotty.

SULU: What do you mean, what do you do with it?<br>
RILEY: Self-defence? Mayhem? Shish kebab?<br>
SULU: You practice.<br>
RILEY: For what?<br>
SULU: Hi, Joey.<br>
RILEY: Last week it was botany he was trying to get me interested in. I
was supposed to be collecting leaves, plant specimens.<br>
SULU: Your attitude is all wrong. Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens
the eye, improves the posture. You tell him, Joey.
Explain to him. Hey, Joey. You feeling all right?<br>

something that we've got no business. What are we doing out here,
anyway?<br>
SULU: Take it easy, Joe.<br>
TORMOLEN: We bring pain and trouble with us, leave men and women stuck
out on freezing planets until they die. What are we doing out here in
space? Good? What good? We're polluting it, destroying it. We've got no
business being out here. No business.<br>
RILEY: Take it easy, Joe.<br>
SULU: Now calm down.<br>
TORMOLEN: If a man was supposed to fly, he'd have wings. If he was
supposed to be out in space, he wouldn't need air to breathe, wouldn't
need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death.<br>
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down, huh?<br>
SULU: You're all steamed up, Joe.<br>
TORMOLEN: We don't belong here. It's not ours. Not ours. Destroying and
watching. We don't belong. I don't belong. Six people died down there.
Why do I deserve to live?<br>
SULU: What are you doing, Joe?<br>
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down. (grabs his arm) Don't be a fool.<br>

have the knife!<br>

like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.<br>

gonna ask me if it's connected.<br>

UHURA: I have no intercom for Sickbay. He keeps switching channels on
me.<br>
KIRK: See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty
first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.

SPOCK: We have fourteen minutes left.<br>

faster, not and maintain a safety factor.<br>
SPOCK: At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll
take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a
safety factor.

CHAPEL: Mister Spock, (takes his hand) the men from Vulcan treat their

I know you don't, you couldn't, hurt me, would you? I'm in love with
you, Mister Spock. You, the human Mister Spock, the Vulcan Mister Spock.<br>

KIRK: What is it?<br>

thirty minutes to regenerate them.<br>
UHURA [OC]: Ship's outer skin is beginning to heat, Captain. Orbit plot
shows we have about eight minutes left.<br>

SCOTT: That's only a theory. It's never been done.<br>
KIRK: Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?<br>

assuming we had a row of computers working weeks on the right formula.<br>

Hey Doc, what am I doing here?<br>
MCCOY: McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.<br>
HARRISON [OC]: What, Doctor?<br>
MCCOY: It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex
chain of molecules.<br>
HARRISON [OC]: What's that, Doctor?<br>
MCCOY: That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through
perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses
the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell
them the serum works, and start preparing more.<br>
SULU: Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right.<br>

No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a

ashamed.<br>

KIRK: Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's
possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun
in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand
chance!<br>

understand?<br>

KIRK: I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and
I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't
permit me my life. I've got to live hers.<br>
SPOCK: Jim.<br>
KIRK: I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock?
You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted<br>
SPOCK: Jim, there is an intermix formula.<br>
KIRK: Now I know why it's called she.<br>

braid on my shoulder.<br>

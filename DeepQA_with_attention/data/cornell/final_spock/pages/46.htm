CHEKOV: Mine, too. <br>
UHURA: Captain. Look. <br>
(People are approaching them. One big guy in a fur, with teeth that
hold his mouth open, another male with a knife, a female in pink
carrying a lance-like weapon, and another in silver with green hair.)
KIRK: Phasers on stun. Fire. (nothing happens) Hand-to-hand. <br>
(The men go one-on-one while Uhura has to deal with both women
simultaneously. They are not fairly matched. Chekov cannot handle the
giant and Uhura quickly gives up. Only Kirk acquits himself well
against the normal male, until green-hair intervenes with her weapon.)

KIRK: Either of you hurt? <br>
UHURA: I don't think so, Captain. <br>
CHEKOV: Nobody's hurt, Captain. Yet. <br>
GALT: Admirable, Chekov. Admirable. You also, Uhura. Your spirit is as
great as the captain's. I can see you all will prove invaluable here. I
am Galt, Master Thrall of the planet Triskelion. I have been sent to

GALT: The Providers were expecting you, Captain. They arranged your
transportation. <br>
KIRK: These Providers of yours, are they <br>
GALT: Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs. <br>
KIRK: What do they want from us? <br>
GALT: You are to be trained, of course. What other use is there for
thralls? <br>
KIRK: Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United
spaceship on Federation business. <br>
GALT: There has been no mistake. Your old titles mean nothing here,
Captain. You are thralls now. You are to be taken to the training
enclosure. (the restraints are released) Come. Places have been
prepared for you. <br>
KIRK: We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are
you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Mister Spock, I've checked that transporter
from one end to the other. Every circuit works perfectly. Whatever that
power surge was, it had nothing to do with the transporter or any other
system aboard this ship. <br>
SPOCK: I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two
sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life. <br>
MCCOY: Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are
just floating around out there? <br>
SPOCK: No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors. <br>
SCOTT: Where are they then?
<br>SPOCK: The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic
interference, no breakdown in your equipment. <br>
MCCOY: A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them
out there, wherever they are. <br>
SPOCK: We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is
all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation. <br>
MCCOY: Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree
of contamination.

(As the doors slide open, Chekov and Kirk hit their minders and they
all run. Galt's eyes glow, the collars glow and the Starfleet escapees
collapse, choking.) <br>
GALT: That was foolish, Captain. Escape is quite impossible, as
demonstrated by your collars of obedience. Return to your quarters. <br>

solar system. <br>
MCCOY: It's been nearly an hour. Can people live that long as
disassembled atoms in a transporter beam? <br>
SPOCK: I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a
fascinating project. <br>
MCCOY: Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if
they're still alive. <br>
SPOCK: Precisely. <br>
MCCOY: The odds are not good. <br>
SPOCK: No. I would say approximately four hundred <br>
MCCOY: Don't quote odds and don't give me anymore dispassionate logic,
Mister Spock. Just keep looking for them. <br>
SPOCK: I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as
to where to look. <br>

an occasion like this.

know where it is. <br>

getting a fluctuating energy reading on this hydrogen cloud. It's
faint, sir, but it consistently reads an excess of predictable energy
level. <br>
SPOCK: Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.<br>
MCCOY: What would account for that, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor.
And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it. <br>

account for that. <br>

HAINES: (now in Chekov's seat) Aye, sir. <br>

<br>
KIRK: It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in
trouble. <br>
(He kisses her.) <br>
SHAHNA: And this. Is this also helping? <br>
KIRK: You could call it that. <br>
SHAHNA: Please, help me once again. (another kiss) I did not know it
could be like this between people. Is it always so in the place you
come from? <br>
GALT: (popping out of thin air) Captain, you do indeed present many
surprises. Because you have amused the Providers, there will be no
punishment. Return to your quarters.

than warp six? <br>
SCOTT: It's my opinion that we've gone too far as it is, sir. <br>
MCCOY: He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two.
Now you've dragged us a dozen light years on some wild hunch that <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction
was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma
system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed
into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching.
No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that
clarify the situation? <br>
MCCOY: No, it doesn't. It's still a fancy way of saying that you're
playing a hunch. well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead
or alive and I still want another search. <br>
SCOTT: Doctor McCoy speaks for me, too, sir. <br>
SPOCK: I see. (pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we
shall continue on our present course. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless
it is your intention to declare a mutiny. <br>
SCOTT: Mister Spock! <br>
MCCOY: Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared.
All right. If we don't find them here, do we still have another search
on Gamma Two? <br>
SPOCK: Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven? <br>
SCOTT: I would be more than content to do so, sir, and maybe a wee bit
more. <br>
SPOCK: Ensign, warp seven. </font></p>

KIRK: You're disturbed about what happened today. <br>
SHAHNA: Yes. You have made me feel strangely. If it were allowed, I
would ask that you have another drill thrall.
<br>KIRK: I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all. <br>

KIRK: What about Lars? <br>
UHURA: He's gone to report me. I said I didn't like the food. <br>

can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to
short out these collars. <br>

SPOCK: There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and
the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by
beaming down a large contingent. <br>
MCCOY: Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and
wait. <br>
SPOCK: Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded. <br>
MCCOY: And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling
you. <br>
SPOCK: I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a
landing party may be necessary. <br>

need a medical officer. <br>

KIRK [OC]: What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider. <br>
ONE [OC]: We are known to the thralls as Providers because we provide
for all their needs. The term is easier for their limited mental
abilities to comprehend. </font></p>

transparent dome with three yellow brains in it.) <br>
KIRK: The power source. Shielded by solid rock.<br>
ONE [OC]: (a brain pulsates red) We are one thousand of your metres
beneath the surface. <br>
KIRK: Primary mental evolution. Incredible. <br>
TWO [OC]: (pulsing green) That is not true, Captain. Once we had
humanoid form, but we evolved beyond it. <br>
THREE [OC]: (yellow) Through eons of devoting ourselves exclusively to
intellectual
pursuits, we became the physically simple, mentally superior creatures
you see before you. <br>
KIRK: A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally
or otherwise. <br>
ONE [OC]: The thralls are necessary to the games. We have found
athletic competitions our only challenge, the only thing which
furnishes us with purpose. <br>
KIRK: It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect. <br>
ONE [OC]: We use only inferior beings. <br>
KIRK: We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of
superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe. <br>
THREE [OC]: An interesting speculation, Captain. You and your people
are most challenging. <br>
TWO [OC]: Yes, most challenging. It was hoped that such new blood would
stimulate our stock of thralls. How unfortunate that you must be
destroyed. <br>
KIRK: Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the
Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation. <br>
ONE [OC]: Your ship will be destroyed by a magnetic storm. No
communications with your base will be possible. Your fate will remain a
mystery to your people. <br>
KIRK: And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the
spirit to really wager for the lives you take. <br>
ONE [OC]: Wager? Explain yourself, Captain. <br>
KIRK: My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful
gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame,
women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for
proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy. <br>
THREE [OC]: We are aware of your competitive abilities, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right
here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls
set against us. <br>
THREE [OC]: A hundred quatloos on the newcomers. <br>
ONE [OC]: Four hundred quatloos against the newcomers. <br>
TWO [OC]: Two hundred quatloos against! <br>
THREE [OC]: Five hundred for the newcomers. Contest by multiple
elimination. <br>
KIRK: Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos.
The stakes must be higher. <br>
ONE [OC]: Name your stakes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety.
Further more, all the thralls on the planet must be freed. <br>
TWO [OC]: Anarchy. They would starve. <br>
KIRK: You will educate and train them to establish a normal
self-governing culture. <br>
THREE [OC]: Thralls govern themselves? Ridiculous! <br>
KIRK: We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are
you willing to admit that we can do something you can't? <br>
TWO [OC]: There is nothing we cannot do! <br>
ONE [OC]: And if you lose, Captain? <br>
KIRK: If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the
Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe.
We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without
rebellion. You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting
wagering you've ever had. <br>
ONE [OC]: Your stakes are indeed high, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Not for true gamesters. <br>
THREE [OC]: We will accept your stakes on one condition. <br>
KIRK: Name it. <br>
ONE [OC]: As leader of your people, your spirit seems most indomitable.
We suggest you alone, pitted against three contestants of our choosing.
<br>
KIRK: Three against one? Those are pretty high odds. <br>
TWO [OC]: Not for true gamesters, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Your, your terms are unfair. <br>
ONE [OC]: On the contrary, they're extremely fair, since your
alternative is death. <br>
KIRK: Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms. <br>

ONE [OC]: Captain, you will defend. Thralls must stay in the blue area.
You will take the yellow. Touching an opposing colour deprives a
contestant of one weapon.
An opponent must be killed to be removed from the game. If only
wounded, he is replaced by a fresh thrall. Is that clear, Captain? </font></p>

outside their allotted colours from time to time. Kirk manages to trip
up or push over each of his three opponents several times. Eventually
he throws his pole into Kloog's belly then picks up a dagger to defend
himself with. Lars traps his hand in the net, but Kirk ducks as the
Andorian throws his pole. Now the two fight with just the
daggers, until Kirk throws the Andorian. Galt sees that he is only
injured, and orders in his replacement.)<br>
GALT: Shahna. <br>
(She enters the area with a pole.) <br>
SHAHNA: You lied. Everything you said. <br>
(She trips him, but he grabs the pole and pulls her down to the point
of his dagger. They both hesitate, break free, and she gets him at her
mercy. Again there is hesitation, so Kirk uses his legs to grab her and
this time puts the blade firmly to her throat.) <br>
SHAHNA: The thralls surrender! <br>

of the wager will be honoured. You are free. Remove your collars. <br>

ONE [OC]: They will be trained. We have said it. <br>
KIRK: I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one
you've been playing. I'm sorry, Shahna. I didn't lie. I did what was
necessary. Someday, I hope you'll understand. <br>
SHAHNA: I understand, a little. You will leave us now? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>

teach you. Learn it, Shahna. all your people must learn
before you can reach for the stars. Shahna. (he gives her a farewell
kiss) Scotty! <br>

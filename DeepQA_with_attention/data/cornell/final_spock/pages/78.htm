Captain's log, Stardate 5943.7. We have calculated that Beta Niobe will
go nova in approximately three and a half hours.
Its only satellite, Sarpeidon, is a Class M planet, which at last
report was inhabited by a civilised humanoid species.
Now our instruments show that no intelligent life remains on the
planet.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk, McCoy and Spock have beamed down) <br>
SPOCK: The power source we detected is in this building, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Any sign of survivors? <br>
SPOCK: No signs of sapient life forms. <br>
MCCOY: How can a planet full of people just disappear? <br>
KIRK: If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to
mass suicide. <br>
SPOCK: Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This
appears to be an archive or library of some kind. <br>
KIRK: Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what
happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now. <br>
MCCOY: Well, that's fine. Where do we start? <br>
ATOZ: May I help you? I am the librarian. May I be of assistance? <br>
(A silver-haired man, called A to Z - perfect for a librarian) <br>
KIRK: Perhaps you can, Mister <br>
ATOZ: Mister Atoz. I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you. I
had thought that everyone had long since gone.
But the surprise is pleasant one. After all, a library serves no
purpose unless someone is using it. <br>
KIRK: You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go? <br>
ATOZ: It depended on the individual, of course. If you wish to trace a
specific person, I'm sorry, but that information is confidential. <br>
MCCOY: No, no particular person, just people in general. Where did they
go? <br>
ATOZ: Ah, you find it difficult to choose, is that it? Yes, a wide
range of alternatives is a mixed blessing, but perhaps I can help.
Would you step this way, please? <br>
(They walk away from Atoz, and another one steps in front of them from
between a range of shelves) <br>
ATOZ: May I help you? You may select from more than twenty thousand
verism tapes, several hundred of which have only recently been added to
the collection. I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you.
You, sir, what is your particular field of interest? <br>
KIRK: What about recent history? <br>
ATOZ: Really? Oh, that's too bad. We have so little on recent history.
There was no demand for it. <br>
KIRK: It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few
questions. <br>
ATOZ: Of course. Reference services available at the desk. <br>
(Where another Mr. Atoz is sitting) <br>
ATOZ: You're very late. Where have you been? <br>
KIRK: You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are
there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening. <br>
SPOCK: Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our
readings indicated that there was no one here at all. <br>
ATOZ: Of course I know. Everyone on this planet was warned of the
coming nova long ago. They followed instructions and are now safe. And
you had better do the same. <br>
KIRK: Did you say they were safe? <br>
ATOZ: Absolutely. Every single one. <br>
KIRK: Where did they go? <br>
ATOZ: Wherever they wanted to go, of course. It is strictly up to the
individual's choice. <br>
KIRK: I see. And you personally sent all these people on the planet to
safety? <br>
ATOZ: Yes, yes, yes. They are all gone, except you three. Of course, I
had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas. <br>
KIRK: You are the real one, Mister Atoz? <br>
KIRK: Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz. <br>
MCCOY: As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim. <br>
KIRK: Let us take you with us to a place of safety. <br>
ATOZ: No, thank you. I plan to join my wife and family when the time
comes. Now, don't be concerned about me. Think of yourselves. I warn
you most urgently. Make your escape before it's too late. The library
is at your complete service.
I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you.
History of the planet is available in every detail.
Just choose what interests you the most. The millennium, the century,
the date, the moment. The library is your key. (puts a disc in a
reader) Oh! It's in the wrong file. Make your own selection, but
remember, you're very late. <br>
KIRK: We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova? <br>
SPOCK: Three hours, thirteen minutes. <br>
KIRK: This gentleman is not <br>
ATOZ: You, sir. I think you’ll find something interesting over here. <br>
(He leads Kirk to his desk) <br>
ATOZ: Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file. <br>
(Atoz goes off to a machine, while Kirk puts a disc on the player and
sees a town scene with
horse-drawn carriages and a sedan chair. Spock goes over to Mister
Atoz, leaving McCoy browsing images of a snow-covered waste) <br>
ATOZ: Have you made your selection, sir? <br>
SPOCK: Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? <br>
ATOZ: I'm sure I was clear. The period in which you're interested. <br>
SPOCK: I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it? <br>
ATOZ: Ah, this is the atavachron. <br>
SPOCK: Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I <br>
ATOZ: Oh, no, sir, no. I must ask you not to touch the controlling
mechanism. Return and make your selection. When you have chosen, I will
prepare you through the atavachron. <br>
SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Atoz. <br>
(Kirk hears a woman scream from behind a doorway)
KIRK: Spock. Bones. <br>
ATOZ: Wait! I haven't prepared you. <br>
(Kirk runs through the doorway and disappears. He appears in a street
where people dressed as cavaliers are manhandling a wench) <br>
ATOZ: You must be prepared! <br>
(Spock and McCoy go through the doorway) </font></p>

KIRK: I'm a free man, sir. <br>

Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that. What a handsome dish ya
served them, the coxcombs. <br>

he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this
time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.

ZARABETH: Even your name is strange. Forgive me. I've never seen anyone
who looks like you. Why are you here? Are you prisoners too? <br>
SPOCK: Prisoners? <br>
ZARABETH: This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people when he wants
them to disappear. Didn't you come in through the time portal? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We
were sent here by mistake. <br>
ZARABETH: The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from
someplace farther than that. <br>
SPOCK: That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home
is a planet millions of light years away. <br>

possibilities. But they are only stories. This isn't real. I must be

SPOCK: He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to
another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find
him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me
where the time portal is? <br>
ZARABETH: But your friend. He is ill. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never
regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he
is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been
discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid
Captain Kirk. <br>
ZARABETH: You make it sound like an equation. <br>
SPOCK: It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this
problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.
If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you
were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask <br>
ZARABETH: Why? My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely. Two of
them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Kahn. <br>
SPOCK: I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor
Kahn the Tyrant. <br>
ZARABETH: It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen. Zor Kahn
determined to destroy our entire family. He used the atavachron to send
us places no one could ever find us. <br>
SPOCK: Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We
will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and
the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk. <br>
ZARABETH: I can't go through the portal again. If I do, I will die. <br>
SPOCK: You cannot go back? <br>
ZARABETH: None of us can go back. When we come through the portal, we
are changed by the atavachron. That is its function. Our basic cell
structure is adjusted to the time we enter. You can't go back. If you
go through the portal again, you will die by the time you reach the
other side. <br>
MCCOY: (standing) Spock? Where are we? <br>
ZARABETH: You are safe here, McCoy. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I remember you. <br>
SPOCK: Come, Doctor, back to bed. <br>
MCCOY: Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim? <br>
SPOCK: It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back. <br>
MCCOY: What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back. <br>
SPOCK: Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time
portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return
to the library, we shall die. <br>
MCCOY: Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here? <br>
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he
is.

instant death. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook. Have you
ever been told that? <br>
ZARABETH: Not recently. <br>
MCCOY: Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those
matters. <br>
ZARABETH: I hadn't noticed it. <br>
MCCOY: Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct
difference in our approach. <br>
SPOCK: Really? <br>
ZARABETH: It’s something to look forward to. I think you must be well
enough, Doctor, to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer. <br>
MCCOY: No, not yet. <br>
ZARABETH: At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress. <br>
MCCOY: And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license.
Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor around here. <br>
SPOCK: And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the
Enterprise. <br>
MCCOY: I wonder where she is. <br>
SPOCK: Five thousand years in the future. <br>
MCCOY: Thank you. <br>
(Zarabeth leaves them) <br>
MCCOY: I wonder where Jim is. <br>
SPOCK: Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is. <br>
MCCOY: What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything
about it? <br>
SPOCK: What was there to do? <br>
MCCOY: Locate the portal. It can't be too far.<br>
SPOCK: We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of
rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, that was clear to me. <br>
SPOCK: Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back
means. <br>
MCCOY: I don't believe it, Spock. It’s just not like you to give up
trying. <br>
SPOCK: Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We
can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past
just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do
you understand? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I
understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly
motivated to stay in this forsaken waste. <br>
SPOCK: The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago. <br>
MCCOY: You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan. <br>
SPOCK: I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure. <br>
MCCOY: What's happening to you, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago. <br>
MCCOY: Long ago. Of course. Long ago.

SCOTT [OC]: Seventeen minutes. You three had better come back right
away. <br>
KIRK: We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing. <br>

by. <br>
KIRK: No. Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my
orders. Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out. Mister Atoz, where
are you? <br>
ATOZ: May I help you? It’s you. You're lucky you found your way back
here. Now let me process you through the atava <br>
KIRK: No. Mister Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet. We
don't belong in your history. We don't belong on your planet at all. <br>
ATOZ: Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong. <br>
KIRK: No. I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing. <br>
ATOZ: Please, go back! <br>

KIRK: I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of
replicas? Which are you this time, real or not? <br>
(He knocks this one out) <br>
ATOZ: You are evidently a suicidal maniac. I don’t understand what
you're trying to do, but if you continue, both of us will die. and I
for one, do not wish death. <br>
KIRK: If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that. <br>
ATOZ: I don't trust you. <br>
KIRK: Which one are you now, the replica or the real one? <br>
ATOZ: I am the real Atoz. You've done away with my replicas. I regret
what I must now do. <br>
KIRK: You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to
save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away. <br>

here, though I realise it is a misfortune for you. I'm here against my
will too, just as you are. <br>
SPOCK: I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time. <br>
ZARABETH: It's not that I wish to return. This is my time now. I've had
to face that. But it has been lonely here. Do you know what it's like
to be alone? Really alone? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. I know what it is like. <br>
ZARABETH: I believe you do. Have something to eat, please. <br>
SPOCK: If it pleases you. This is animal flesh? <br>
ZARABETH: There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid. <br>
SPOCK: Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in
the shelter? <br>
ZARABETH: There's an underground hot spring. <br>
SPOCK: Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of
sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of
nourishment. <br>
(He takes a bite) <br>
ZARABETH: There aren't many luxuries around here. Zor Kahn only left me
what was necessary to survive. <br>
SPOCK: But he evidently intended that you continue living. <br>
ZARABETH: Yes. He gave me weapons, a shelter, food. Everything I needed
to live except companionship. He did not want it said that he had me
killed. But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is? A
very inventive mind, that man. <br>
SPOCK: But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The
cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention.
I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh
and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're
beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so? <br>
ZARABETH: I have longed to hear you say it. <br>
(They kiss, then he picks her up and smiles broadly) <br>
SPOCK: You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've
ever known.<br>

overpowered) <br>

ATOZ: You're a most determined man. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: What's happening? Why are you waiting? <br>
KIRK: No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out? <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Aye, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait.
Get out fast. Kirk out. Now we're going to start looking. They were in
a frozen waste. I could hear the wind. <br>

Age, five thousand years ago. Let me look. <br>

and that is also something new for you. <br>
SPOCK: I've given you the facts, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's
word because it's what you wanted to believe? <br>
SPOCK: You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what
difference does it make? <br>
MCCOY: Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.
She would do anything to anybody to change that. Wouldn't you,
Zarabeth? <br>
ZARABETH: I told you what I know. <br>
MCCOY: Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get
back. <br>
SPOCK: She would not jeopardise other lives. <br>
MCCOY: She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She
would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the
entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead,
Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill! <br>
SPOCK: What are you doing to her? <br>
(Spock pins McCoy against the cave wall) <br>
MCCOY: Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want?
Think. What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those
feelings before? <br>
SPOCK: This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan. <br>
MCCOY: The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years.
Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very
moment? <br>
SPOCK: My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians. <br>
MCCOY: Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock,
you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you
were born! <br>
SPOCK: I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back? <br>
ZARABETH: I don't know. I only know that I can't go back. <br>
MCCOY: I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there,

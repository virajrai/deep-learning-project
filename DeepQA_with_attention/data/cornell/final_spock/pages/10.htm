UHURA: Beginning signals to surface, sir. <br>
KIRK: Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant. <br>
SPOCK: Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this
planet, Captain.
Gravity is one point one of Earth, atmosphere within safety limits.<br>
KIRK: But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees
below zero. <br>
SPOCK: It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has
been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often
called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of
medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation
techniques. <br>
KIRK: Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted
to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive? <br>
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. No return signal. <br>

interest you that we have aboard this vessel <br>
KORBY [OC]: I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam down
alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries of such a nature they may
require an extraordinary decision from you. <br>
SPOCK: That's an unusual request. <br>

(a man screams, they dash back to the pit. A figure is creeping away,
unseen) <br>
BROWN: Be careful. <br>
KIRK: Is there a path down there? <br>
BROWN: There's no hope, Captain. It's bottomless. He must have slipped.
<br>
KIRK: Any chance of a projection or a ledge? <br>
BROWN: None, Captain. Unfortunate. Terribly unfortunate. Doctor Korby
was detained. I came as soon as I could. <br>
KIRK: Not soon enough. <br>
CHAPEL: Brownie, what is it? <br>
BROWN: Explain. <br>
CHAPEL: Don't you recognise me? <br>
BROWN: Christine. You look well. My name is Brown, Doctor Korby's
assistant. I presume you are Captain Kirk. He's dead, I assure you.
Come, Doctor Korby will be waiting. <br>
KIRK: You do know him well? An old friend? <br>

KIRK [OC]: We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the
Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. <br>
RAYBURN: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK [OC]: And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I
lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam
the security party down immediately. Kirk out. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BROWN: Doctor Korby has discovered that as their
sun dimmed, the inhabitants of this planet moved underground from an
open environment to this dark world. When you were a student of his,
Christine, you must have often heard Doctor Korby remark how freedom of
movement and choice produced the human spirit. The culture of Exo 3
proved his theory. When they moved from light to darkness, they
replaced freedom with a mechanistic culture. Doctor Korby has been able
to uncover elements of this culture which will revolutionise the
universe when freed from this cavernous environment. </font></p>

always thought how beautiful your name is. And you must be Captain Kirk
of the Starship Enterprise. We appreciate you bringing Roger's fiancee
to him. <br>
CHAPEL: I don't remember Doctor Korby mentioning an Andrea. <br>
ANDREA: But you are exactly as Roger described you. No wonder he missed
you so. <br>
KIRK: Where is Doctor Korby? <br>
KORBY: Here, Captain. I, I've been looking forward to (sees Chapel, and
they kiss) <br>
CHAPEL: Oh, I knew I'd find you. <br>
KORBY: Everything's all right now. Oh, forgive me, Captain. I'm, er,
I'm Roger Korby. <br>
KIRK: There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to
introduce yourself. <br>
BROWN: The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor. <br>
KORBY: What? How did it happen? <br>
BROWN: The pit near the outer junction. The edge must have given way. <br>
KORBY: I'm terribly sorry, Captain. Perhaps if I'd been there. I know
the passages so well. <br>
KIRK: It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to
make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your
personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs <br>
KORBY: Captain, I'd much prefer <br>
KIRK: Rayburn, are you receiving? <br>
KORBY: I'd prefer you waited, Captain, please, till I've talked to you.

be things here unknown to you, so terribly important <br>

KORBY: Andrea. <br>
KIRK: What are you doing? <br>
KORBY: This is necessary, Captain. You will understand. Andrea. (she
reaches for Kirk's phaser, but he grabs her to use as a shield and aims
it at Brown instead, while moving towards a table to use as a barrier
instead of the girl) <br>
KIRK: Drop it! (he fires, Brown falls straight backwards and the big
figure bursts in and lifts Kirk off his feet. Chapel screams as she
sees the hole in Brown reveals electronic parts)

At least wait until we can talk. <br>
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right? <br>
RUK [Kirk's voice]: Fine, Mister Spock. Doctor Korby has made some
fascinating discoveries. All under control. Stand by for regular
contact. Kirk out. <br>
KORBY: This is not a vain display, Captain. I'm a scientist. You
obviously know my reputation. Trust me. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are
and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. <br>
KORBY: There's so much you must learn Before you make a final judgment.
For example (to Ruk) Andrea. <br>
RUK [Andrea's voice]: You must be Captain Kirk of the Starship
Enterprise. [Korby's voice] Christine, it's all right now. <br>
KORBY: You see, Captain? <br>
RUK [Christine's voice]: Yes Roger, everything is all right now. <br>
KORBY: That's enough. You are not to mock Christine. You will never
harm her. <br>
KIRK: Or disobey an order from her. <br>
KORBY: You will not disobey her orders. Satisfied, Captain Kirk? Both
love and trust. Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you. <br>
KIRK: Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? <br>
KORBY: What would your first duty be upon return to your vessel?
Report! Do you realise the number of discoveries lost because of
superstition, of ignorance, of a layman's inability to comprehend? <br>
KIRK: A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman?
Alive? Dead? <br>
KORBY: Ruk was programmed to protect my experiments. The logic of his
machine mind saw danger to me. <br>
KIRK: Where is my other crewman? <br>
KORBY: Ruk destroyed them both, totally against my wishes I assure you.
<br>
KIRK: He's an android like Brown? <br>
RUK: More complex than Brown. Much superior. I was left here by the old
ones. <br>
KORBY: Ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here. How
many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. With his help, ith the records I
could find, we built Brown. <br>
KIRK: You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're
dangerous. (makes a run for it but Ruk grabs him and throws him around)

KORBY: Ruk, no!

You are with Roger again. <br>
CHAPEL: Where is Captain Kirk? <br>
ANDREA: You are concerned about the captain?<br>
CHAPEL: Yes, I am concerned.<br>
ANDREA: How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why does it bother
you when I use the name Roger?<br>
KORBY: Andrea, it's sufficient that it does disturb her. You will call
me Doctor Korby from now on, Andrea.<br>
ANDREA: Yes, Doctor Korby. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling. As you
can see, Captain Kirk is fine. He won't be harmed. The things at stake
here simply make it necessary he doesn't send a report to his ship. I
need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you. Now shall we
start with Andrea?<br>
CHAPEL: Yes, let's start with Andrea.<br>
ANDREA: I'm like Doctor Brown, an android. Didn't you know?<br>
KORBY: Remarkable, isn't she? Notice the the lifelike pigmentation, the
variation in skin tones. The flesh, the flesh has warmth. There's even
a pulse, physical sensation.<br>
CHAPEL: How convenient.<br>
KORBY: Christine, you must realise an android's like a computer. It
does only what I
programme.
As a trained scientist yourself, you must realise that <br>
CHAPEL: Given a mechanical Doctor Brown, a mechanical geisha would be
no more difficult.<br>
KORBY: You think I could love a machine?<br>
CHAPEL: Did you?<br>
KORBY: Andrea's incapable of that. She simply obeys orders. She has no
meaning for me. There's no emotional bond. Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk.
Now strike him. You see? There's no emotion in it, no emotional
involvement. She simply responds to orders. She's a totally logical
computer. A thing is not a woman. Now do you understand? <br>
KIRK: If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as
you programme
them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my
men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.<br>
KORBY: I will answer all of your questions now. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KORBY: This is how you make an android. (Kirk is
naked on one side of circular table, a human-shaped blob on the other)
Andrea. (the table starts turning) He's not being harmed, I promise. <br>
CHAPEL: Roger, what's happened to you? When I sat in your class, you
wouldn't even dream of harming an insect or an animal. Their life was
sacred to you then. <br>
KORBY: Christine, if I'd simply beamed up to their vessel with Brown
and the others, I'd have given them objects of curiosity, beginnings of
wild stories, foolish theories. Ruk! Watch carefully. (the blob turns
into Kirk, and the table is stopped) Choose, Christine. Which is your
captain? <br>
CHAPEL: I don't know. They're exact. I honestly don't know. <br>
KORBY: Synthetic organs are in place. We merely synchronise them with
Kirk's autonomic nervous system, duplicating the rhythms of his body.
At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern. Now, physical
pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern. Ready for final
synaptic fusion. Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits. The android will
be so perfect It could even replace the captain. The same memories, the
same attitudes, the same abilities. Activate circuits. <br>
KIRK: Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed
interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm
sick of your half-breed (passes out, the other one wakes up) <br>
KORBY: Complete. <br>

ANDREA: Doctor Korby suggested that you have lunch. He thought you
might have a few things to talk about.<br>
CHAPEL: Captain. <br>
KIRK2: I know, I know. I'd hate to be torn between commander and
fiancée myself.<br>
CHAPEL: No, I'm not torn. I'm puzzled. I'm worried. <br>
KIRK2: Has he confided in you? <br>
CHAPEL: Nothing he hasn't told you. I know it doesn't make sense. What
he's done may seem wrong, but he is Roger Korby, whatever he seems to
be doing. <br>
KIRK2: Unless something's gone wrong with his mind. <br>
CHAPEL: No. You're forgetting how well I know him. He's as sane as you
or I. <br>
KIRK2: Nurse, if I gave you a direct order to betray him <br>
CHAPEL: Please, don't ask me to make that choice. I'd much rather you
push me off the same precipice where Matthews died. Oh, I can't.
(pushes plate away) Please, go ahead and eat. <br>
KIRK2: Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel. <br>
KORBY: He even has your sense of humour. <br>
KIRK: Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. <br>
KIRK2: The difference is your weakness, Captain, not mine. <br>
KORBY: One at a time, gentlemen. Captain? <br>
KIRK: Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never
know. <br>
KIRK2: Perhaps, but I will never starve, sir. <br>
KIRK: He's an exact duplicate? <br>
KORBY: In every detail. <br>
KIRK: What about memory? Tell me about Sam. <br>
KIRK2: George Samuel Kirk, your brother. Only you call him Sam. <br>
KIRK: He saw me off on this mission. <br>
KIRK2: Yes, with his wife and three sons. <br>
KIRK: He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research
station. <br>
KIRK2: No, Captain. He said he was continuing his research and that he
wanted to be transferred to Earth colony two. <br>
KORBY: You might as well try to outthink a calculating machine. <br>
KIRK: Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. <br>
KORBY: Totally unimportant ones. You may leave now. (Kirk2 leaves) You
haven't guessed the rest? Not even you, Christine? What you saw was
only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you
understand? By continuing the process I could've transferred you, your
very consciousness into that android. Your soul, if you wish. All of
you. In android form, a human being can have practical immortality. Can
you understand what I'm offering mankind? <br>
KIRK: Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by
Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. <br>
KORBY: Can you understand that a human converted to an android can be
programmed for the better? Can you imagine how life could be improved
if we could do away with jealousy, greed, hate? <br>
KIRK: It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness,
sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor. <br>
KORBY: No one need ever die again. No disease, no deformities. why even
fear can be programmed away, replaced with joy. I'm offering you a
pracical heaven, a new paradise, and all I need is your help. <br>
KIRK: All you wanted before was my understanding. <br>
KORBY: I need transportation to a planet colony with proper raw
materials. I'm sure there are several good possibilities among your
next stops. No diversion from your route. I want no suspicions aroused.
I'll begin producing androids carefully, selectively. <br>
KIRK: Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. <br>
KORBY: They must be strongly infiltrated into society before the
android existence is revealed. I want no wave of hysteria to destroy
what is good and right. You with me, Captain? <br>
KIRK: You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? <br>
KORBY: I created him to impress you, not to replace you. <br>
KIRK: I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! (leaps up with
cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat)
Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back. (goes through door,

KIRK: And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over
again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that
logic cannot solve. <br>
RUK: Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago, I had forgotten. The old ones
here. The ones who made us, yes. Yes, it is still in my memory banks.
It became necessary to destroy them. You are inconsistent. You cannot
be programmed. You are inferior. <br>
KIRK: And Korby?<br>
RUK: You came from the outside. You bring disorder here. <br>
KIRK: The danger to you is Korby. <br>
RUK: I was programmed by Korby. I cannot harm him. <br>
KIRK: The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to
destroy them.<br>
RUK: That was the equation! (seizes Kirk) Existence! Survival must
cancel out programming.<br>
KIRK: That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to
destroy you! <br>
KORBY: Ruk, I would like <br>
RUK: You brought him among us. You brought the inferior ones. We had
cleansed ourselves of them. Now you bring the evil back!<br>
KORBY: Ruk, stop! Your programming. (fires phaser, Ruk vanishes) I had
no choice.

alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I
was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps
his arm in a door. The skin tears to reveal electronics)

here. You can't imagine how it was. I was frozen, dying. My legs were
gone. I was, I had only my brain between life and death. This can be
repaired easier than another man can set a broken finger. I'm still the
same as I was before, Christine, perhaps even better.<br>
CHAPEL: Are you, Roger? <br>
KORBY: (into comm. unit) Andrea.<br>
ANDREA [OC]: Yes, Doctor. <br>
KORBY: There's someone in the outer junction. <br>
KIRK: Spock. He must've got my message. <br>
ANDREA [OC]: I will find Ruk. <br>
CHAPEL: But he'll never find us in this maze. <br>
KORBY: Ruk has been shut off.

human, rational, and without a flaw. <br>
ANDREA: He freed himself, and I destroyed, (sees Kirk there) destroyed
him. I am not programmed for alarms. I listened to your instructions.
They were mis-stated. <br>
KIRK: She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is
this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another?
Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no
more concern than when you turn off a light? <br>
KORBY: I'm not a computer. Test me. Ask me to solve any, equate,
transmit. Christine, Christine, let me prove myself. Does this make
such a difference?<br>
CHAPEL: Don't you see, Roger? Everything you've done has proved it
isn't you.<br>
KORBY: I am Roger Korby!<br>
KIRK: Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left
in you, give it to me.<br>
KORBY: No. You will never understand. I constructed a perfect being,
tested it, proved it. Proved it. Proved it? (hands phaser to Kirk) <br>
KIRK: Andrea, give me the weapon.<br>
ANDREA: No. Protect. Protect. (to Korby) To love you. To, to kiss you. <br>
KORBY: No. You cannot love. You're not human.<br>
ANDREA: Love you. Kiss. (Korby reaches for trigger and disintegrates
them both)<br>

KIRK: In here, Spock.<br>
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?<br>
KIRK: Doctor Korby was never here.

KIRK: She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister
Spock?<br>
SPOCK: Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term
half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated
expression. <br>
KIRK: I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a
similar situation. Steady as we go, helm. </font> </p>

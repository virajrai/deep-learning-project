boulder.) <br>
SPOCK: Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure
tritanium. <br>
KIRK: Fantastic. 20 times as hard as diamond. <br>
SPOCK: Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Mister Spock. (into communicator) Scotty, you can mark
this vein as confirmed. Inform Starfleet I recommend that they dispatch
a survey vessel immediately. <br>
(Unseen by the landing party, a cloud of smoke is coming out of another
rock and heading for them.) <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Acknowledged, Captain. They'll send one fast enough for
this rich a find. <br>
SPOCK: We won't be able to break it, Captain. I'll phaser off a
specimen. <br>
(He does so, and the smoke retreats.) <br>
KIRK: Lesley. <br>
(He is handed a pair of tongs to pick up the sample with.) <br>
KIRK: Do you smell that? A sweet odour like honey. It was years ago, on
another planet. A thing with a an odour like that. <br>
SPOCK: We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet.
There are doubtless many pollen aromas. <br>
KIRK: Rizzo. <br>
RIZZO: Yes, sir? <br>
KIRK: Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for
dikironium in the atmosphere. Set your phasers on disrupter-B. If you
see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately. You're on Red Alert. Make a
sweep. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Ready to beam back aboard, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: The USS Yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less
than eight hours, Captain. That doesn't give us much time. <br>
KIRK: Acknowledged. Continue standing by. Kirk out. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments. <br>
KIRK: It's gone. I could have been wrong. The last time I caught an
odour like that was eleven years ago. </font></p>

RIZZO: Seemed to read dikironium for a minute, and then I lost it. It's
almost like something out there knows I'm scanning it.
It kind of keeps changing itself into something different. That isn't
possible. Nothing can do that. <br>

CHAPEL: Continuing as rapidly as possible. His blood count is still
sixty percent less than normal. (leaves) <br>
KIRK: Kirk to bridge. <br>
SPOCK [on monitor]: Spock here. Ready to leave orbit, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Hold your position. <br>
SCOTT [on monitor]: Cutting in if I may, Captain. The USS Yorktown is
expecting to rendezvous with us in less than seven hours. <br>
KIRK: Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late.
Those vaccines he's transferring to us are highly perishable. <br>
SPOCK [on monitor]: Spock again, Captain. Those medical supplies are
badly needed on planet Theta Seven. They are expecting us to get them
there on time. <br>
KIRK: Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about
those deaths, on my responsibility. I am perfectly aware that it might
cost lives on Theta Seven. Kirk out. Autopsy report. <br>
MCCOY: You saw their colour. There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their
bodies. <br>
KIRK: Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind? <br>
MCCOY: Not a one. What happened is medically impossible. <br>
KIRK: I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar
occurrences. You'll find the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years
ago from exactly the same impossible causes. <br>
MCCOY: Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately. <br>
KIRK: First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, but it <br>
KIRK: Will it hurt him if you do so? <br>

KIRK: Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what
happened to you? <br>
RIZZO: Remember. I'm cold. I'm so cold. <br>
KIRK: You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice
an odour of any kind? Rizzo. Rizzo! Do you remember a sickly sweet
odour? Did you smell it? <br>
RIZZO: Yes. Yes. A smell. A strange smell. It was like being smothered
in honey. <br>
KIRK: Did you feel a presence, an intelligence? <br>
RIZZO: It was trying to draw strength from us. I felt it. It was, it
was, it was there. <br>
MCCOY: He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot. <br>
KIRK: He's already told me what I wanted to know. <br>
MCCOY: I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious
state. He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear.

KIRK: You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as
quickly as possible. (leaves) <br>

Starfleet. They're inquiring <br>
KIRK: Not now. Have the security duty officer report to me immediately.
<br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the
planet. <br>
KIRK: Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our
sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form. <br>
SPOCK: You mentioned dikironium, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous
creature. <br>
SPOCK: I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of
dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere. <br>
KIRK: Suppose it camouflaged itself. Let's assume that it's
intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it. <br>
SPOCK: To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change
its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood
changing itself to ivory. <br>
KIRK: You've just suggested something that never occurred to me. It may
provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor
McCoy is looking at this very moment. <br>
SPOCK: Chekov, take over on scanner. <br>
(As Spock steps into the turbolift, Garrovick steps out onto the
bridge.) <br>
GARROVICK: Ensign Garrovick reporting, sir. <br>
KIRK: Are you the new security officer? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Was your father <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that
account. <br>
KIRK: You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister. <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
UHURA: Captain, I have a report on Ensign Rizzo. He's dead, sir. <br>
KIRK: You knew Rizzo? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. We were good friends, graduated the Academy
together. <br>
KIRK: You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, I am, sir. <br>
KIRK: I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect.
Join me in the transporter room in five minutes. You'll accompany me to

KIRK: Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?&nbsp;<br>
GARROVICK: Dikironium reading now, sir. Bearing ninety four mark seven,
angle of elevation six degrees. Holding steady. <br>
KIRK: Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll
take the other two and go the other way. That creature is dangerous. If
you see it, fire full phasers. <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Swensen, Bardoli come with me. <br>

Garrovick fires at it after a slight hesitation.) <br>

pale as snow.)

of the galaxy. Both Spock and McCoy are doubtful of this, and I sense
they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing. Why am I

Garrovick enter.) <br>
KIRK: Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin.
<br>
SPOCK: What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign? <br>
GARROVICK: I'd say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres, sir. It
varied in size, fluctuated as it moved. <br>
SPOCK: Composition? <br>
GARROVICK: It was like a, a gaseous cloud. Parts of it I could see
through. Other parts were more dense. <br>
MCCOY: Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud? <br>
GARROVICK: Did I what, sir? <br>
MCCOY: Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a
creature. A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of
chemical elements? <br>
GARROVICK: No, sir. <br>
KIRK: But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you? <br>
GARROVICK: No, sir. I was furthest away from it. It seemed to come out
of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men. It was
fast, incredibly fast. <br>
KIRK: Did you say it hovered? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: You did fire at it, didn't you? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir, I did. <br>
KIRK: What distance were you from the creature? <br>
GARROVICK: About twenty yards, sir. <br>
KIRK: You fired at a large, hovering target at that distance and
missed? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes. I, er, well, I didn't fire while it was hovering, sir. <br>
KIRK: You mean you froze? <br>
GARROVICK: No, sir. I didn't exactly freeze. <br>
KIRK: What exactly were you doing? <br>
GARROVICK: Well, I was startled for a second. And then by the time I
fired, the thing was already moving. <br>
KIRK: Do you have any further information? <br>
GARROVICK: No, sir. <br>
KIRK: Do you gentlemen have any further questions? <br>
GARROVICK: I only hesitated for a moment, sir. I'm sorry. <br>
KIRK: Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters
until further notice. <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. (leaves) <br>
MCCOY: You were a little hard on the boy, Jim. <br>

require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do
not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded
fixation on one idea. <br>
MCCOY: Jim and his creature? <br>
SPOCK: Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS
Farragut? <br>
MCCOY: No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance
to scan the tapes. There are eight or ten hours of record tape there. <br>
SPOCK: Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly
half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was
Garrovick. <br>

deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I

KIRK [OC]: Personal log, stardate 3620.7. Have I the right to
jeopardise my crew, my ship for a feeling I can't even put into words?
No man achieves Starfleet command without relying on intuition, but
have I made a rational decision? Am I letting the horrors of the past
distort my judgment of the present? <br>
MCCOY: Mind if I come in? <br>

MCCOY: Sometimes they do, if we're lucky. Monsters come in many forms.
You know the greatest monster of them all, Jim? Guilt. <br>
KIRK: Get to the point. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the
first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress. Now we all know
that. <br>
KIRK: Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out
of your field, Doctor. <br>
(He returns to his bed.) <br>
MCCOY: Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship
Farragut. Eleven years ago, you were the young officer
at the phaser station when something attacked. According to the tapes,
this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself. <br>
KIRK: Because I delayed in firing at it. <br>
MCCOY: You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing
for a grand total of perhaps two seconds. <br>
KIRK: If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed. <br>
MCCOY: The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite
clear on the subject. Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who
performed with uncommon bravery. <br>
KIRK: Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen. <br>
MCCOY: Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim? <br>
KIRK: Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the
Academy. One of the finest men I ever knew. I could have killed that
thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time. <br>
MCCOY: You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you
know that Garrovick could have destroyed it. <br>
KIRK: I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones.
A malevolence. It's evil. It must be destroyed. <br>
MCCOY: To be so obsessed. <br>
KIRK: Obsessed? <br>
MCCOY: That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who
reminds you of yourself eleven years ago. <br>
KIRK: Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take
official <br>
MCCOY: I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a
medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional
condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command
grade. <br>
(McCoy goes to the door and opens it to admit Spock.) <br>
KIRK: Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of
you consider me unfit or incapacitated? <br>
SPOCK: Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Our
reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent
behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We
respectfully ask permission to inquire further <br>
KIRK: Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions. <br>
SPOCK: Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It
carries perishable drugs <br>
KIRK: Skip the recitation, Spock. I know the facts. <br>
MCCOY: They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we
delaying here? <br>
KIRK: Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that
attacked the Farragut eleven years ago. <br>
SPOCK: Creature, Captain? <br>
KIRK: My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as
I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I
could sense it thinking, planning. <br>
SPOCK: You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it
communicate with you? <br>
MCCOY: You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A
semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much
is real or how much is imagination. <br>
KIRK: Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it
deadly? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, there's no doubt about that. <br>
KIRK: And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years
ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here? <br>
SPOCK: Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is
the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel,
it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets. <br>
KIRK: A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh
other factors. Intuition, however illogical, Mister Spock,
is recognized as a command prerogative. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you. <br>
KIRK: And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern,
you've asked the proper questions. You've both done your duty. Now may
I ask what medical log entry you intend to make? <br>

SPOCK: The deflectors will not stop it, Captain. <br>
SCOTT: That's impossible. <br>
SPOCK: I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use
gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity. <br>
CHEKOV: Five seconds to contact. All hatches and vents secure. All

have a red light! <br>

speech lost under Chekov's increasing volume) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Report. <br>
SCOTT: When it entered impulse engine number two's vent, it attacked
two crewmen. It then got into the ventilating system, and now we have
air for only two hours. <br>
KIRK: Bones? <br>
MCCOY: One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can
add that little price tag to your monster hunt. <br>
KIRK: That's enough, Bones. <br>
MCCOY: It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your
trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it.<br>
SPOCK: May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether
or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been
rendered academic. The creature is now after us. <br>
MCCOY: Creature, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered
and intelligent. <br>
KIRK: Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us.
Instead it chose to turn and attack here. Why? <br>
SPOCK: Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of
the creature. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation
system. See what effect that has. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. (leaves) <br>
MCCOY: I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong. (leaves) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync
makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser
hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you
had fired on time and on target eleven years ago,
it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain
Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact,
there was no fault. <br>
KIRK: If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My
concern is with the ship and the crew. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GARROVICK: Come in. <br>
SPOCK: Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed
by what you consider to be a failure on your part? (a nod) I would like
you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself
is an hereditary trait of your species.
When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will
experience a split second of indecision. He hesitates.
Do I have your attention, Ensign? <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
SPOCK: I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than <br>
GARROVICK: Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here <br>
SPOCK: Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe
we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that
your reaction has its basis in physio. (suddenly stops and sniffs) Do
you smell something? <br>
GARROVICK: Sir, it's coming through the vent. <br>
SPOCK: Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off. <br>

to the vent, but the damaged switch breaks off in his hand.)

GARROVICK: He saved my life, Captain. I should be lying dead in there,
not him. <br>
(The cabin door opens.) <br>
SPOCK: Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure
worked. The vent is closed. <br>
KIRK: Don't misunderstand my next question. Mister Spock, why aren't
you dead? <br>
MCCOY: It's that green blood of his. <br>
SPOCK: My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron. <br>
MCCOY: I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too. <br>
SPOCK: Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct. <br>
KIRK: Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now. <br>
SPOCK: Do you believe you're in communication with the creature? <br>
KIRK: I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said
the thing was alive. It may not be communication as we understand it,
but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know
something else now. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Engineering to Captain Kirk. Engineering to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Scott, Captain. The creature's moving back toward the

KIRK: Open the vent. On my way to the bridge. Kirk out. Ensign
Garrovick. <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: You were on the bridge when we were attacked. <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, I'm sorry, sir. I know I was confined to quarters, but
when the alert sounded <br>
KIRK: Very commendable, Ensign. What was your impression of the battle?
<br>
GARROVICK: I don't understand, sir. <br>
KIRK: I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used
against the creature. <br>
GARROVICK: Ineffective, Captain. I realise, Captain, you did everything
you could do. I know that. It's just that nothing works against a
monster
that can do the things that thing does. <br>
KIRK: And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?
<br>
GARROVICK: I delayed firing. <br>
KIRK: If you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, Ensign. No weapon
known would have made any difference. Then or eleven years ago.
Report for duty, Ensign. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Report, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: Results positive, Captain. The creature has left the ship at
high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range. The way
that thing can move, Captain, I wouldn't believe it. <br>
KIRK: Direction, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now. <br>
KIRK: (into intercom) Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can
deliver. Keep at it until we begin to shake apart. Kirk out. I believe
I know where it's going. <br>
SPOCK: It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would
dictate that <br>
KIRK: No, I'm playing intuition. Mister Chekov, compute a course for
Tychos star system. <br>
CHEKOV: Computed and on the board. <br>
KIRK: Ahead full. <br>
CHEKOV: Ahead full, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the USS Yorktown. <br>
UHURA: Frequency open and clear, sir. <br>
KIRK: Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of
that system. That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut
eleven years ago. <br>
SPOCK: I do not understand, Captain. <br>
KIRK: In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was
somehow different. Something in my mind said home. <br>
SPOCK: And you know where home is, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Yes, I think I do. I don't know how I know, but home is where it
fought a starship once before. Ito Uhura) Inform them of our tactical
situation and inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction
of the creature. We will rendezvous. Round-trip time, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: One point seven days, sir. <br>
KIRK: We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in forty eight hours. <br>
(later) <br>
MCCOY: I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and
destroy it. <br>
SPOCK: Precisely. <br>
KIRK: You don't agree with Mister Spock? <br>
MCCOY: It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are
perishable. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so,
it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands. <br>
KIRK: Antimatter seems our only possibility. <br>
SPOCK: An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's
engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum
field. <br>
KIRK: Contact medical stores. I want as much haemoplasm as they can
spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes. <br>
GARROVICK: Yes, sir. <br>
MCCOY: I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the
creature? <br>
KIRK: We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood
cells. What better bait could we have? <br>
SPOCK: There is still one problem, Captain. <br>
KIRK: The blast, yes. <br>
SPOCK: Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the
planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those
shock waves <br>
KIRK: A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under
those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose
him. <br>
KIRK: That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the
creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for
me to be the one <br>
KIRK: Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you
aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan. <br>
SPOCK: It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit. <br>
GARROVICK: I'd like permission to go with you, sir. <br>
KIRK: I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick.

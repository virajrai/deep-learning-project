Captain's log, stardate 3192.1. The Enterprise is en route to star
cluster NGC 321. Objective, to open diplomatic relations with the
civilisations known to be there. We have sent a message to Eminiar
Seven, principal planet of the star cluster, informing them of our
friendly intentions. We are awaiting an answer.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Nothing yet, Lieutenant? <br>
UHURA: Nothing, Captain. Hailing frequencies are open. <br>
(Ambassador Fox enters the Bridge from the turbolift.) <br>
FOX: Have you received an answer to your message yet, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Nothing yet, Ambassador. We're awaiting a reply. Today's the
first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal. <br>
UHURA: Captain, message coming in from Eminiar Seven. Sir, it's code
seven-ten. <br>
KIRK: Are you sure? <br>
UHURA: Positive. It repeats over and over. <br>
FOX: Is that supposed to mean something? <br>
KIRK: Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach
that planet. No circumstances what so ever. <br>
FOX: You will disregard that signal, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Fox, it is their planet. <br>
FOX: Captain, in the past twenty years, thousands of lives have been
lost in this quadrant. Lives that could have been saved if the
Federation had a treaty port here. We mean to have that port and I'm
here to get it. <br>
KIRK: By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an
interplanetary war. <br>
FOX: I'm quite prepared to take that risk. <br>
KIRK: You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew. <br>
FOX: I have my orders, Captain, and now you have yours. You will
proceed on course. Achieve orbit status and just leave the rest to me.
You're well aware that my mission gives me the power of command. I now
exercise it. You will proceed on course. That's a direct order. <br>
(He leaves.) <br>
SPOCK: In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest <br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert.
Phaser crews stand by. Deflector shields up. We're going in.
Peacefully, I hope. But peacefully or not, we're going in.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 3192.5. Now in standard

civilisation is advanced. They've had space flight for several
centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system.
When first contacted more than fifty years ago, Eminiar Seven was at
war with its nearest neighbour. <br>
KIRK: Anything else? <br>
SPOCK: The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its
mission. The USS Valiant. Listed as missing in space. <br>
FOX: Kirk, what's this about you going down alone? <br>
KIRK: Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me. <br>
FOX: It is my prerogative. <br>
KIRK: I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of
reception you're going to receive. Your safety is my responsibility.
Those are my orders, sir. Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Transporter room standing by, Captain. <br>
KIRK: What co-ordinates? <br>
SPOCK: We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an
official establishment. <br>
KIRK: Final sensor readings? <br>
SPOCK: No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us
at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit.
Obviously, they know we're here. <br>
KIRK: Ship's defences? <br>
SPOCK: Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status,
Captain. <br>
KIRK: Good. Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the
arsenal. Keep them inconspicuous. Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, aye, sir. And have a bonny trip. <br>
KIRK: We'll do our best. Let's go. </font></p>

KIRK: Yes? <br>
MEA: You were warned not to come here. <br>
KIRK: I had orders to come here. Why did your people tell us to stay
away? <br>
MEA: It was for your own safety, Captain. <br>
KIRK: I see no danger here. <br>
MEA: The danger exists. Nevertheless, you are here. It would be morally
incorrect to do less than extend our hospitality. Anan 7 and members of
the High Council await you. If you will come this way, please. </font></p>

KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock,
Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula. <br>
ANAN: Welcome to Eminiar Seven. Well, Captain, what can we do for you? <br>
KIRK: My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your
people and mine. <br>
ANAN: That is impossible. <br>
KIRK: Would you mind telling me why? <br>
ANAN: Because of the war. <br>
KIRK: You're still at war? <br>
ANAN: We have been at war for five hundred years. <br>
KIRK: You conceal it very well. Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly
advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people,
and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no
evidence of this. <br>
ANAN: Casualties among our civilian population total from one to three
million dead each year from direct enemy attack. That is one reason,
Captain,
why we told you to stay away. As long as your ship is orbiting our
planet, it is in severe danger. <br>
SPOCK: With whom are you at war? <br>
ANAN: The third planet in our system, called Vendikar. Originally
settled by our people and now a ruthless enemy. Highly advanced
technologically. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
ANAN: Please excuse me. Vendikar is attacking. Mea, care for our
guests. <br>
(The Council adjourn into an adjacent room filled with computer
equipment.) <br>
SPOCK: Strange. <br>
KIRK: To say the least. <br>
MEA: It will not last long. <br>
KIRK: Don't you take shelter? <br>
MEA: There is no shelter, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: Are these attacks frequent? <br>
MEA: Oh yes, and we will retaliate immediately. <br>
(She sees an area flare on a map) <br>
MEA: Oh! <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
MEA: A hit right here in the city. <br>
KIRK: Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula. <br>
TAMULA: Sir? <br>
SPOCK: Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind. <br>
(She scans the area) <br>
TAMULA: Working, sir. No evidence. <br>
KIRK: Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is
using? <br>
MEA: Fusion bombs, materialised by the enemy over their targets. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Bridge. Scotty? <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Scanners operative on the planet's surface? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Anan rejoins the group) <br>
ANAN: It's a vicious attack, extremely destructive. Fortunately, our
defences are firming, but our casualties are high. Very high. <br>
KIRK: Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this
entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of
yours,
we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no
radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game
you're playing <br>
ANAN: This is no game, Captain. Half a million people have just been
killed. Activate the attack units, Sar. <br>
SAR: Yes, Councilman. <br>
ANAN: Launch immediate counter attack. <br>
SPOCK: Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers.
Totally. <br>
ANAN: Yes, of course. <br>
KIRK: Computer don't kill a half million people. <br>
ANAN: Deaths have been registered. Of course they have twenty four
hours to report. <br>
KIRK: To report? <br>
ANAN: To our disintegration machines. You must understand, Captain, we
have been at war for five hundred years. Under ordinary conditions,
no civilisation could withstand that. But we have reached a solution. <br>
SPOCK: Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical. <br>
ANAN: Oh, no, quite real. An attack is mathematically launched. I lost
my wife in the last attack. Our civilisation lives. The people die, but
our culture goes on. <br>
KIRK: You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration
machine when they're told to? <br>
ANAN: We have a high consciousness of duty, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: There is a certain scientific logic about it. <br>
ANAN: I'm glad you approve. <br>
SPOCK: I do not approve. I understand. <br>
ANAN: Good. Then you will recall I warned you not to come here. You
chose to ignore my warning. I'm sorry, but it's happened. <br>
KIRK: What has happened? <br>
ANAN: Once your ship was in orbit about our planet, it became a
legitimate target. It has been classified destroyed by a tricobalt
satellite explosion. All persons aboard your ship have twenty four
hours to report to our disintegration machines. In order to ensure
their co-operation, I have ordered you, Captain, and your party held in
custody until they surrender. If possible, we shall spare your ship,
Captain, but its passengers and crew are already dead.

KIRK: We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven. <br>
MEA: He's busy co-ordinating casualty lists. <br>
KIRK: He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if
he doesn't get in here and talk to me. <br>
MEA: Don't you understand? Our duty <br>
KIRK: Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and
disappearing. <br>
MEA: I'm afraid mine does, Captain. I too have been declared a
casualty. I must report to a disintegrator by noon tomorrow. <br>
KIRK: Is that all it means to you? To report and die? <br>
MEA: My life is as dear to me as yours is to you, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Then how can you stand <br>
MEA: Don't you see? If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then
Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons. We would have
to do the same to defend ourselves. More than people would die then. A
whole civilisation would be destroyed. Surely you can see that ours is
a better way. <br>
KIRK: No, I don't see that at all. <br>

launched an attack against our ship. Now

without turning around.) <br>
ANAN: Won't you join me in a drink, Captain? You'll find our trova most
interesting. <br>
KIRK: I didn't come to drink. <br>
ANAN: I assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber
number twelve. <br>
KIRK: A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it. <br>
ANAN: My first impression was correct. You are a barbarian. <br>
KIRK: I am? <br>
ANAN: Don't sound so incredulous, Captain. Of course you are. We all
are. A killer first, a builder second. A hunter, a warrior, and let's
be honest, a murderer. That is our joint heritage, is it not? <br>
KIRK: We're less cold-blooded about it than you are. <br>
ANAN: What do you want, Captain? <br>
KIRK: I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators? <br>
ANAN: In a safe place. <br>
KIRK: You take a lot of chances, Councilman. <br>
ANAN: You're worried about your ship, Captain. I'm trying to save a
world. <br>
KIRK: If I were you, I'd think about saving my life. <br>
ANAN: Won't you have a drink, Captain? <br>
(Kirk pours himself a slug of trova, and as he turns his back, Anan
presses concealed buttons.) <br>
ANAN: And then we can discuss our differences. <br>
KIRK: I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem
to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and
herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing,
Councilman. I could destroy this planet. <br>
ANAN: Why do you think I don't let you talk to your ship ? <br>
KIRK: I don't need the ship for that. <br>
ANAN: You mean, all by yourself with a disruptor, you can destroy this
planet? <br>
KIRK: That's exactly what I mean. <br>
ANAN: I had no idea you were so formidable. <br>
KIRK: You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators? <br>
ANAN: If I told you, Captain, would you walk right out and get them? <br>
KIRK: Something like that. <br>
ANAN: Very well, Captain. They're in the War Room. Go left down the

ANAN: You will be responsible for an escalation that will destroy
everything. Millions of people horribly killed. Complete destruction of
our culture here and yes, the culture on Vendikar. Disaster, disease,
starvation, horrible, lingering death, pain and anguish! <br>

ANAN: It would frighten any sane man. <br>
KIRK: Yes. You're quite right. <br>
ANAN: Don't you understand, Captain? We have done away with all that.
Now you are threatening to bring it down on us again. Are those five
hundred people of yours more important than the hundreds of millions of
innocent people on Eminiar and Vendikar? What kind of monster are you? <br>

are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits. <br>

KIRK: Cross your fingers. Kirk out. Death, destruction, disease,
horror. That's what war is all about, Anan. That's what makes it a
thing to be avoided. You've made it neat and painless. So neat and
painless, you've had no reason to stop it. And you've had it for five
hundred years. Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and

all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in

(There is a very satisfying series of explosions.) <br>
ANAN: You realise what you have done? <br>
KIRK: Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans
now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing
to wage real war with real weapons. They'll want do the same. Only the
next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a
computer. They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet. You of course
will want to retaliate. If I were you, I'd start making bombs. Yes,
Councilman, you have a real war on your hands. You can either wage it
with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative. Put an end to
it. Make peace.&nbsp;<br>
ANAN: There can be no peace. Don't you see? We've admitted it to
ourselves. We're a killer species. It's instinctive. It's the same with
you. Your General Order Twenty Four. <br>
KIRK: All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought.
We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our
hands, but we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers, but we're
not going to kill today. That's all it takes. Knowing that we won't
kill today. Contact Vendikar. I think you'll find that they're just as
terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to
avoid the alternative I've given you. Peace or utter destruction. It's
up to you. <br>
FOX: As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of
normal relations, I should be glad to offer my services as negotiator
between you and Vendikar. I've had some small experiences in such
matters. <br>
ANAN: There may be a chance. We have a direct channel with Vendikar's
High Council. It hasn't been used in centuries. <br>

KIRK: Good. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, you took a big chance. <br>
KIRK: Did I, Mister Spock? They've been killing three million people a
year. It had been going on for five hundred years. An actual attack
wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer
attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war. The
fighting would have been over permanently. <br>
MCCOY: But you didn't know that it would work. <br>
KIRK: No. It was a calculated risk. Still, the Eminians keep a very
orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business. A very, very
messy business. I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid
it, even talk peace. <br>
SPOCK: A feeling is not much to go on. <br>
KIRK: Sometimes a feeling, Mister Spock, is all we humans have to go
on. <br>

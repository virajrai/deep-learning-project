<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KIRK: Any response from the Malurians, Lieutenant?
<br>
UHURA: Nothing since their original distress call, sir. <br>
KIRK: What about the Federation science team working there? Doctor
Manway had a special transmitter. <br>
UHURA: There's nothing, sir. I'm scanning all frequencies. <br>
KIRK: They have to answer. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of
this system reveals no sign of life. <br>
KIRK: That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of
more than four billion people. <br>
SPOCK: I register no life readings at all, sir. <br>
KIRK: That's impossible. What could have happened? <br>
SPOCK: We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe,
and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable
radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background
radiation. <br>
KIRK: Any other possibilities? <br>
SPOCK: Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence
of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the
routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene
blood burn does not act that swiftly. <br>
SULU: Captain, shields just snapped on. Something heading in at
multiwarp speeds. <br>
KIRK: Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu. <br>
SPOCK: An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Full power to the shields, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Giving them all we got. <br>
KIRK: All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to
Condition Red, Condition Red. <br>
(The viewscreen fills with a ball of bright light.) <br>
SULU: It's going to hit. <br>
(Everyone gets thrown around a lot, and the lights go out for a short
while.) <br>
SCOTT: Shields still holding, sir. <br>
KIRK: Good. <br>
SPOCK: Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to
ninety of our photon torpedoes. <br>
KIRK: Ninety? <br>
SPOCK: I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced
our shielding power twenty percent. <br>
UHURA: First attack, sir? <br>
KIRK: I think we can expect others, Lieutenant. <br>
SPOCK: We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter
our shields completely. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive
manoeuvres. <br>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them
what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have
been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an
unidentified force. <br>
(Another ball of light is on the viewscreen) <br>
KIRK: Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres. <br>
SULU: We're losing power, sir. <br>
KIRK: Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: I'm having to divert the warp engine power into the shields,
sir, if you want the protection. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, speed of those bolts. <br>
SPOCK: Approximately warp fifteen, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right
thing. (another hit) Source, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. (a third bolt
approaching) Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three
degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres. <br>
KIRK: That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo. <br>
(The third bolt hits) <br>
SCOTT: Shields still holding, sir, but the drain on the engines is
reaching the critical point.
Ach, we lost warp manoeuvreing power. Switching to impulse. <br>
SULU: Photon torpedoes armed, sir. <br>
KIRK: Has the target changed location, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: No, sir. Holding steady. <br>
KIRK: Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Ready, sir. <br>
KIRK: Fire. <br>
SULU: Torpedo away. (a pause, then a flash) Direct hit. <br>
SPOCK: No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo. <br>
KIRK: Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock . <br>
SPOCK: They are in good working order, Captain. <br>
KIRK: But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived?
Lieutenant, try to make contact. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
SULU: Sir, they've fired another. <br>
KIRK: Can we take it, Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: That's problematical, sir. <br>
(It hits.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit. <br>
KIRK: Anything, Lieutenant? <br>
UHURA: I'm trying, sir. <br>
KIRK: Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. All hailing frequencies open. <br>
KIRK: To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS
Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any
lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister
Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape,
roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre. <br>
KIRK: Five hundred kilos and only one metre long? <br>
SCOTT: What kind of intelligent creatures can exist in a thing that
small? <br>
SPOCK: Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott. <br>
UHURA: Captain, we're getting a signal from the spacecraft. <br>
KIRK: Put it on audio, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. It's impossible to get it any clearer, sir. <br>
KIRK: Analysis sector. Have them study and decode it. <br>
UHURA: Analysis sector, channel one, main computer. Decode. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely
sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once. <br>
KIRK: Can you decode it? <br>
SPOCK: No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has
stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary. <br>
UHURA: It's mathematical. Yes, one symbol. The symbol repeat. Sir, that
isn't in the Starfleet code. It's an old-style interplanetary code. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: Repeat what? The message I sent? <br>
SPOCK: It would seem so, Captain. <br>
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a
peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile
intentions. We request identity. <br>
UHURA: It's another signal now, sir. <br>
SPOCK: It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical
message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to
communicate. <br>
KIRK: Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel. Let
them take it at their own speed. <br>
UHURA: Aye, Captain. <br>
(Suddenly one of Spock's console monitor's burns out.) <br>
SPOCK: Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out. <br>
KIRK: I guess they can take it faster than we give it. <br>
UHURA: Captain, the message is coming in now. <br>
NOMAD [OC]: USS Enterprise, this is Nomad. My mission is non-hostile. <br>
KIRK: Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned
out. <br>
SPOCK: Nomad? <br>
NOMAD [OC]: Require communication. Can you leave your ship? <br>
KIRK: It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size
differential. <br>
NOMAD [OC]: Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated. <br>
KIRK: We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship. <br>
NOMAD [OC]: That will be satisfactory. <br>
KIRK: Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere
or environment? <br>
NOMAD [OC]: Negative. I will come aboard. <br>
KIRK: Good. Hold your position. We're locked onto your co-ordinates.
We'll beam you aboard. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, you're not really bringing that thing in here? <br>
KIRK: Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it
won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on
that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock,
you come with me. Scotty, you too. <br>
UHURA: Doctor McCoy to the transporter room. Maintenance crew C5. </font></p>

and flashing lights on the side - is hanging in mid air over the
transporter pad.) <br>
KIRK: Sensor readings, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get
through. <br>
MCCOY: What do we do now, go up and knock? <br>
NOMAD: Relate your point of origin. <br>
KIRK: We are from the United Federation of Planets. <br>
NOMAD: Insufficient response. All things have a point of origin. I will
scan your star charts. <br>
KIRK: If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of
reference. It won't know more than it does now. <br>
SPOCK: A reasonable course. <br>
KIRK: If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life
support systems. <br>
NOMAD: Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, I don't think anybody's in there. <br>
NOMAD: I contain no parasitical beings. I am Nomad. <br>
.
SCOTT: In my opinion, that's a machine. <br>
SPOCK: It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer. <br>
NOMAD: I am Nomad. What is opinion? <br>
SPOCK: An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment. <br>
NOMAD: Insufficient response. <br>
SCOTT: What's your source of power? <br>
NOMAD: It has changed since the point of origin. There was much taken
from the other. I am perpetual now. I am Nomad. <br>
KIRK: Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s? <br>
SPOCK: Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the
series. But if this is that probe <br>
NOMAD: I will scan your star charts. <br>
KIRK: I will bring them. <br>
NOMAD: I have the capability of movement within your ship. <br>
KIRK: This way. <br>
(Nomad glides along slowly, in mid-air) <br>
KIRK: Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>

SPOCK: Chart 14A, sir? <br>
KIRK: 14A. (a diagram of our solar system comes up on a screen) Nomad,
can you scan that? <br>
NOMAD: Yes. <br>
KIRK: This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol. <br>
NOMAD: You are from the third planet? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
NOMAD: A planet with one large natural satellite? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
NOMAD: The planet is called Earth? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
NOMAD: You are the creator, the Kirk. The sterilisation procedure
against your ship was unnecessary. <br>
KIRK: What sterilisation procedure? <br>
NOMAD: You are the Kirk, the creator. You programmed my function. <br>
MCCOY: Well, I'm not the Kirk. Tell me what your function is. <br>
NOMAD: This is one of your units, creator? <br>
KIRK: Yes, he is. <br>
NOMAD: It functions irrationally. <br>
KIRK: Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless. <br>
NOMAD: My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy
that which is not perfect. I am Nomad. <br>
KIRK: Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for
that. <br>
SPOCK: I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll
have the readout in a moment. <br>
KIRK: Did you destroy the Malurian system? <br>
NOMAD: Not the system, creator Kirk. Only the unstable biological
infestation. It is my function. <br>
MCCOY: Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind
of function <br>
KIRK: Doctor. Why do you call me the creator? <br>
NOMAD: Is the usage incorrect? <br>
KIRK: Well, I <br>
SPOCK: The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory
banks. <br>
NOMAD: There was much damage in the accident. <br>

SPOCK: I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad
probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe. <br>
MCCOY: Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with
those capabilities that long ago. <br>
SPOCK: True. <br>
KIRK: Nomad was destroyed. <br>
SPOCK: Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was
badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the
most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to
build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You
recall his name. <br>
MCCOY: Of course. Jackson Roykirk. <br>
KIRK: Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk. <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are
Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded
to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted. <br>
KIRK: What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock? <br>
MCCOY: (looking at the schematic on the monitor) That's not the same. <br>
SPOCK: Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it
than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The
unanswered question is, the other what? <br>
Nomad was a thinking machine, the best that could be engineered. It was
a prototype. <br>
KIRK: Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and
destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into
it. <br>
MCCOY: As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first
interstellar probe to seek new life-forms. <br>
SPOCK: Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been
changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect
life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic. <br>
KIRK: If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a
device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security. <br>
CARLISLE [OC]: Lieutenant Carlisle here. <br>
KIRK: This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the
auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five
minutes. <br>
CARLISLE: Aye, sir. Acknowledge. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the
auxiliary control room. <br>

KIRK: All right, Nomad. Repair the unit. <br>
NOMAD: I require tapes on the structure. <br>
MCCOY: Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous
system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd
better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as
tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram. <br>
(Spock loads up the data.) <br>
SPOCK: Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed
of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the
machine's capacity. <br>
NOMAD: Proceed. (a few moments later) Creator, the unit Scott is a
primitive structure. Insufficient safeguards built in. Breakdown can
occur from many causes. Self-maintenance systems of low reliability. <br>

KIRK: We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its
compulsion for perfection. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe. <br>
KIRK: Get into direct mental contact with that thing? <br>
SPOCK: It seems the only way. <br>
KIRK: You saw what it did to Uhura. <br>
SPOCK: There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must
check it out. <br>
KIRK: Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you. It is not an attack. It is
a form of communication. You will permit it. <br>
NOMAD: I will permit it, Creator. <br>
(Spock puts one hand on Nomad's head, where the antenna are, and the
other on its body where the lights and ticking are coming from.) <br>
SPOCK: I. Am. Nomad. I am performing my function. Deep emptiness, It
approaches. Collision. Damage. Blackness. I. Am. The other. I am Tan
Ru, Tan Ru. Nomad. Tan Ru. Error. Flaw. Imperfection. Must sterilise.
Rebirth. We are complete. Much power. Gun ta. Noo. Icka. Tan Ru. The
creator instructs. Search out. Identify. Sterilise imperfections. We
are Nomad.
We are Nomad. We are complete. We are instructed. Our purpose is clear.
Sterilise imperfections. (he lets go of Nomad) Sterilise imperfections.
Nomad. Sterilise. Sterilise. Nomad, sterilise, <br>
KIRK: Spock. Spock! Nomad! You're in contact with the unit Spock. Stop!
Stop! <br>
NOMAD: Acknowledged. <br>

activates the security forcefield.) </font></p>

SPOCK: Fascinating, Captain. The knowledge. The depth. <br>
KIRK: What does it mean, we are Nomad? <br>
SPOCK: It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor
collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It
wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an
alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged,
repaired each other, became one. <br>
KIRK: Then it isn't Nomad? <br>
SPOCK: Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new
directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to
secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a
prelude to colonisation. <br>
KIRK: A changeling. <br>
SPOCK: I beg your pardon? <br>
KIRK: An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy
child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed
the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for
sterilise read kill. <br>
SPOCK And it has the power and sophistication to do it. <br>
KIRK: Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible.
It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its mother. <br>
SPOCK: And that is the only thing that has saved us until now. <br>
Yes. <br>
(They leave. Nomad flies through the forcefield. The two guards fire
their phasers at it but it's screens are back up. Nomad zaps them into
oblivion.)

SCOTT: Notify the captain. What are you doing here? Watch your panels,
everyone. Watch that polymass. Roger, help with the interfactor. Leave
that alone. <br>
NOMAD: This primitive matter-antimatter propulsion system is the main
drive? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. <br>
NOMAD: Inefficiency exists in the antimatter input valve. I will effect
repair. <br>
(The indicator board goes crazy.) <br>
SCOTT: How are you doing that? <br>
NOMAD: The energy release controls are also most inefficient. I shall
effect repair. <br>
ENGINEER: Warp eight, Mister Scott, and increasing. <br>
SCOTT: Throw your dampers. <br>
ENGINEER: Warp nine. <br>
SCOTT: Cut your circuits, all of them. <br>
ENGINEER: Warp 10, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Impossible. It can't go that fast. <br>
ENGINEER: It just won't stop, Mister Scott. Warp eleven! <br>
KIRK: Nomad, stop what you're doing. Scotty? <br>
NOMAD: Is there a problem, Creator? I have increased engine efficiency
fifty seven percent. <br>
KIRK: You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress
of that much power. Turn off your repair operation. <br>
NOMAD: Acknowledged. It is reversed as ordered, Creator. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. <br>
(Spock enters, leaving two guards outside.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the
security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume
they are dead. <br>
KIRK: You killed two of my <br>
NOMAD: Creator, your biological units are inefficient. <br>
KIRK: Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a
biological unit, and I created you. <br>
NOMAD: (pause) Non sequitur. Biological units are inherently inferior.
This is an inconsistency. <br>
KIRK: Nomad, there are two men waiting outside. You will not harm them.
They will escort you back to the waiting area. You will stay there. You
will do nothing. <br>
NOMAD: I am programmed to investigate. <br>
KIRK: I have given you new programming and you will implement it. <br>
NOMAD: There is much to be considered before I return to launch point.
I must re-evaluate. <br>
(Nomad follows the guards down the corridor away from Engineering.) <br>
KIRK: Reevaluate? <br>
SPOCK: I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it
may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit.
In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect. <br>
KIRK: It was a foolish mistake. <br>
SPOCK: Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point,
Earth. <br>
KIRK: Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when
it tapped the computers earlier? <br>
SPOCK: I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities. <br>
KIRK: And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there <br>
SPOCK: It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
<br>
KIRK: And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise.

turbolift.)<br>

not open automatically for them.) <br>

KIRK: Is she all right? <br>
MCCOY: I think so. Looks like some kind of shock. <br>
KIRK: What happened? <br>
MCCOY: Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories.
She tried to stop him. <br>
KIRK: Whose history? <br>
MCCOY: Yours. <br>
SPOCK: Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has
completed its re-evaluation. <br>
KIRK: And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other
biological units. <br>

KIRK: Nomad? Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the

NOMAD: Stop. <br>
KIRK: You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator. <br>
NOMAD: I am programmed to destroy those life-forms which are imperfect.
These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which
surrounds them. It, too, is imperfect, but can be adjusted. <br>
KIRK: Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a
biological unit created you. <br>
NOMAD: I am perfect. I am Nomad. <br>
KIRK: No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming
tapes have been altered. <br>
NOMAD: You are in error. You are a biological unit. You are imperfect. <br>
KIRK: But I am your creator. <br>
NOMAD: You are the Creator. <br>
KIRK: I created you? <br>
NOMAD: You are the Creator. <br>
KIRK: But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a
perfect thing as you? <br>
NOMAD: Answer unknown. I shall analyse. <br>
(Spock enters, with Scott, two engineers and the requested anti-grav
units) <br>
NOMAD: Analysis complete. Insufficient data to resolve problem, but my
programming is whole. My purpose remains. I am Nomad. I am perfect.
That which is imperfect must be sterilised. <br>
(The engineers remove the unconscious men and take their places at the
controls.) <br>
KIRK: Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and
is imperfect? <br>
NOMAD: I shall continue. I shall return to launch point Earth. I shall
sterilise. <br>
KIRK: You must sterilise in case of error? <br>
NOMAD: Error is inconsistent with my prime functions. Sterilisation is
correction. <br>
KIRK: Everything that is in error must be sterilised. <br>
NOMAD: There are no exceptions. <br>
KIRK: Nomad, I made an error in creating you. <br>
NOMAD: The creation of perfection is no error. <br>
KIRK: I did not create perfection. I created error. <br>
NOMAD: Your data is faulty. I am Nomad. I am perfect. <br>
KIRK: I am the Kirk, the creator? <br>
NOMAD: You are the Creator. <br>
KIRK: You are wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead. You have
mistaken me for him. You are in error. You did not discover your
mistake. You have made two errors. You are flawed and imperfect and you
have not corrected by sterilisation. You have made three errors. <br>
NOMAD: Error. Error. Error. Examine. <br>
KIRK: You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function! <br>
NOMAD: I shall analyse error. Analyse error, <br>

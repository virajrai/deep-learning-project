<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: They're quite large. Seven feet tall is not
unusual. They're extremely fast and strong. Lieutenant? <br>
(Uhura turns on a monitor) Make no mistake. They can be highly
dangerous. The Capellans' basic weapon, the kligat. At any distance up
to a hundred yards, they can make it almost as effective against a man
as a phaser. <br>
(On the monitor, we see McCoy being given a demonstration in which a
small sapling is cut in half by one of these hand-thrown objects.) <br>
MCCOY: In addition, an assortment of swords and knives. <br>
UHURA: Call from the bridge, Captain. <br>
SULU [OC]: Bridge, Helm, sir. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Mister Sulu. Report. <br>
SULU [on monitor]: Now in standard orbit, sir. I've pinpointed their
encampment below. <br>
KIRK: Very good. Have the transporter room stand by. <br>
SULU [on monitor]: Aye, sir. <br>
SCOTT: How long were you stationed on the planet, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Only a few months. We found them totally uninterested in medical
aid or hospitals. They believe only the strong should survive. <br>
KIRK: Analysis, gentlemen. <br>
SPOCK: Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a
large, well-armed landing party. <br>
KIRK: Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the
greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos. <br>
MCCOY: Agreed. Once they've got it into their heads we're showing
force, you can forget them signing any mining treaty. <br>
KIRK: Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the
Klingons have been sighted in this sector. While we're negotiating down
there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. We'll keep on our toes.

down.) <br>
MAAB: Halt! You are of the Earth vessel? <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. <br>
MCCOY: We come with open hearts and hands. <br>
GRANT: A Klingon! <br>
KIRK: Grant, no! <br>
(Too late. A Capellan kills him with a kligat.) <br>
MCCOY: Don't move a muscle.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 3497.2. Planet Capella
Four. The rare mineral topaline, vital to the life-support systems of
planetoid colonies, has been discovered in abundance here. Our mission,
obtain a mining agreement. But we've discovered a Klingon agent has
preceded us to the planet. A discovery which has cost the life of one
of my crewmen.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KRAS: I am unaware of any state of war between our
peoples, Captain. <br>
MCCOY: Jim! <br>
KRAS: Or is it your policy to kill Klingons on sight? <br>
KIRK: He was young, and inexperienced. <br>
MCCOY: Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their
own words? <br>
MAAB: We understand only that he also offers things of value for our
rocks, and he has freely handed us his weapons and other devices. Will
you do the same? <br>
KIRK: Let me call my ship and inform them <br>
KRAS: To bring down an attack upon their village? It is as I told you,
Maab. Earthmen fear to bargain honestly. <br>
MAAB: Will you hand us your weapons? <br>
(Phasers and communicators are thrown down at Maab's feet.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tent]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Traces of bedouin-style, with low furniture,
plenty of furs and a metal brazier providing warmth and light. There
are two guards outside.) <br>
KIRK: So they keep their word scrupulously. They're unusually honest.
Is that what I heard you say, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I mentioned that. <br>
SPOCK: He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous. <br>
KIRK: Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated. We lied to
no one, Doctor. We violated no customs. Perhaps you'll explain to me
why one of my men is dead. <br>
MCCOY: Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests. <br>
KIRK: Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive
defensive move. What's a Klingon doing down here among your
scrupulously honest friends anyway? <br>
MCCOY: Look, Jim. I know what it means to you to lose a crewman. <br>
KIRK: That's only one down, Doctor. There's over four hundred more up
there in orbit. And if there's a Klingon down here, there might be a
Klingon ship up there somewhere. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHEKOV: Mister Scott. I'm picking up something on
the sensors, sir. Seems to be another ship. <br>
SCOTT: Well, let's put it on the screen. <br>
(A small dot on the monitor above the science station.) <br>
CHEKOV: It's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir. Hard to get an
exact reading. <br>
SULU: You think it's a Klingon ship? <br>
SCOTT: Who else would be playing cat and mouse with a starship? Well,
they can't hurt us much out there, bobbing about like that. No need to
call the captain yet. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Bones. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, Captain? <br>
KIRK: I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry. <br>
MCCOY: I understand. <br>
SPOCK: Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical.
<br>
(A woman enters with a large bowl of fruit.) <br>
MCCOY: You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. She's
making a gesture in return. <br>
(She offers Kirk a piece.) <br>
MCCOY: Jim! You touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to
kill you. They're offering you a chance for combat. They consider it
more pleasurable than love. <br>
MAN: Chur-ah. <br>
SPOCK: It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Teer's tent]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A middle-aged man sits on a throne, surrounded by
his guards.) <br>
AKAAR: I am the teer Akaar. I lead the Ten Tribes of Capella. <br>
(A heavily pregnant woman enters and sits.) <br>
AKAAR: And this is Eleen, a young wife to give an old man a son to rule
these tribes. <br>
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. First of all, I must protest the killing of my
crewman. <br>
AKAAR: If it was your man, wasn't it his privilege to die for you? I do
not understand. <br>
MAAB: Their customs are different, Teer. <br>
KRAS: And different from those of my people, too, Teer. The sight of
death frightens them. <br>
MCCOY: Let me take this, Jim. What Maab has said is true. Our customs
are different. What the Klingon has said is unimportant, and we do not
hear his words. I just called the Klingon a liar. <br>
MAAB: Laughter, Teer? Is not the Klingon an honoured guest also? <br>
AKAAR: It was the Earth people who first bargained for our rocks. <br>
MAAB: Is it not best to have two who bargain for the same goods? <br>
AKAAR: It is I who speak for the tribe, Maab. <br>
MAAB: I speak for many, Teer. Hear the words of the Klingon. <br>
KRAS: What do Earth men offer you? What have you obtained from them in
the past? Powders and liquids for the sick? We Klingons believe as you
do. The sick should die. Only the strong should live. Earthmen have
promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things. What? What
things? Cleverness against enemies? The use of weapons? <br>
ELEEN: The Klingon speaks the truth, Akaar. <br>
KIRK: The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar. Our laws. And
the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will
always remain yours. This differs us from the Klingons. Their empire is
made up of conquered worlds. They take what they want by arms and
force. <br>
MAAB: Good, good. Let the Klingons and the Earthmen offer us amusement.
Capellans welcome this. <br>
AKAAR: The Earth men have different customs, but never have they lied
to our people. <br>
MAAB: There are those of us who won't bargain with Earthmen, Akaar. <br>
AKAAR: Do you say you will fight me, Maab? <br>
MAAB: Let that be your choice, Teer. <br>
(Maab, Kras and the Orange man leave.) <br>
KIRK: We need our communicators, those devices on our belts. If there's
a Klingon ship somewhere <br>
AKAAR: The sky does not interest me. I must consider the words I have
heard. <br>
ELEEN: Leave him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHEKOV: The ship's disappeared, sir. Gone out of
range. <br>
UHURA: Mister Scott, I'm getting a call from a vessel. It's so faint I
can't make it out. <br>
SCOTT: Put a booster on it, Lieutenant. Try to pull it in. <br>
UHURA: I've lost it. It sounded like a distress signal from an Earth
vessel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Klingon! Communicators, weapons. <br>
KRAS: I have no quarrel with you, Captain. I wish merely to return to
my vessel. <br>
(He grabs a knife and lunges at Kirk, who throws him easily and turns
the weapon on the Klingon.) <br>
KIRK: Type of vessel. Location. <br>
KRAS: A small scout ship, Captain. We need the mineral, too. I was sent
to negotiate. <br>
MAAB: Release him. (Kirk does so.) Akaar is dead. I am the teer. <br>
KRAS: Kill them now. <br>
KIRK: Wait. If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right
decisions. <br>
KRAS: Is the new leader of the Ten Tribes afraid? Let me kill him for
you. <br>
KIRK: Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you. <br>
MAAB: Perhaps to be a teer is to see in new ways. I begin to like you,
Earthman, and I saw fear in the Klingon's eye. <br>
KRAS: We had an agreement. <br>
MAAB: That too may change, Klingon. </font></p>

It is a distress call. It's from the SS Dierdre. <br>

manoeuvre. It's a Klingon vessel attacking. <br>

KIRK: I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The
Klingon ship. <br>
SPOCK: That would seem a logical conclusion. <br>
MCCOY: Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm. They can only kill
me once for touching her. <br>

mean you'd prefer to die? I think we can get you safely to the ship.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, stardate 3499.1. Before leaving the
Capellan encampment, we managed to retrieve our communicators. Our
phasers were not to be found. We've fled into the hills, yet we know
the Capellans will eventually find us by scent alone, if necessary. And
we've learned one thing more. The girl, Eleen, hates the unborn child
she is carrying.

way of an exit. I'll take a look around. <br>
MCCOY: Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high
teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and
injured. Now, let me see that arm. <br>

coming after them.) <br>
(McCoy scans Eleen's belly, then puts his hand on it.) <br>

MCCOY: You listen to me, young woman. I'll touch you in any way or
manner that my professional judgment indicates. <br>
(She slaps his face, twice, so he slaps her in return.) <br>
MCCOY: Just as I thought. It can come anytime now. <br>
ELEEN: How do you know? <br>
MCCOY: Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know. <br>
ELEEN: Even the women of our village cannot tell so much with a touch.
Strange hand. Very soft. <br>
(Spock and Kirk meet up.) <br>
SPOCK: The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out. <br>
KIRK: Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd
give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills. <br>
SPOCK: There is enough loose rock and shale. <br>
KIRK: Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our
communicators? <br>
SPOCK: Only a very slight chance it would work. <br>
KIRK: Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I didn't say that exactly. <br>
(The Capellans are getting close to the canyon entrance.) <br>
SPOCK: The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the
weak area of that slide. <br>
(The party is led by Maab, who senses something is wrong but keeps
coming forward until the
rock face explodes. Kras hides but other Capellans are crushed by the
falling boulders. When the dust starts to clear, Kras takes the
Federation phasers from a wounded Capellan then kills him with his own
knife. The remaining members of the posse move on.) <br>
KIRK: Worried about the delivery? <br>
MCCOY: Capellans aren't human, Jim. They're humanoid. There's certain
internal differences. I don't have equipment to handle an emergency. <br>
KIRK: Well, if you don't think you can handle it <br>
MCCOY: Forget it. I can do it. The last thing I want around is a
ham-handed ship's captain. <br>
(They continue their climb up the canyon. It is steep and Eleen is
struggling. Kirk goes to help.) <br>
ELEEN: No! Only McCoy. <br>
KIRK: There's a cave in there. Probably the only shelter around here. <br>
MCCOY: I'll need help getting her in there. <br>

SCOTT: Mister Chekov? <br>
CHEKOV: Nothing. <br>
SCOTT: We're turning back. Warp five, Helm. <br>
SULU: Warp five, sir. On course for Capella Four. <br>
SCOTT: Warp 6 as soon as she'll take it, Mister Sulu. The captain could
be in trouble back there. <br>
UHURA: Mister Scott, another distress call from the USS Carolina. <br>
SCOTT: Ignore it. <br>
UHURA: The Carolina is registered in this sector. <br>
SCOTT: Ignore it, Lieutenant. Log it as my order, my responsibility. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SULU: Scotty, if it should turn out to be real <br>
SCOTT: There's an old, old saying on Earth, Mister Sulu. Fool me once,
shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. <br>
CHEKOV: I know this saying. It was invented in Russia. (he smirks to
himself) </font></p>

for the Capellans when McCoy wakes.) <br>
MCCOY: Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock! <br>
KIRK: What happened, Bones? <br>
MCCOY: My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone. <br>
SPOCK: The child? <br>
MCCOY: It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry,
stick with surgery. I really thought she'd learned to want it. <br>
SPOCK: Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the
warriors. <br>
MCCOY: I'll go with you. <br>
KIRK: Bones, you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my
ship. That small patient in there needs you. </font></p>

SULU: Thirty one minutes, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: Mister Scott? Sensors picking up a vessel ahead, cutting across
our path. <br>
SCOTT: Sub-light one half. <br>
SULU: Reversing to sub-light, one half. <br>
CHEKOV: It's an alien, sir. By configuration a Klingon warship. Taking
position directly in our path. <br>
SCOTT: Mister Sulu, sound battle stations. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
UHURA: This is the USS Enterprise calling unidentified Klingon vessel.
Come in. USS Enterprise calling Klingon vessel. Acknowledge, please. <br>
SULU: I have it on the viewscreen now, sir. Still distant. Holding a
position dead ahead, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Drawing a line, daring us to step over it. <br>
SULU: Still closing. The alien's directly in our line of flight. <br>
SCOTT: This is the commander of the USS Enterprise. Identify yourself
and your intention. Acknowledge. Close out the frequency, Lieutenant. <br>
SULU: Phaser banks are ready, sir. <br>

they have the belly for it. </font></p>

Capellans, who are travelling single file. Maab stops the column and
sends a scout ahead.) <br>
KEEL: Behind the rocks up there. <br>
MAAB: The Earthmen make excellent game. Their cleverness has surprised
me. <br>
KRAS: (slightly out of breath) They must die. That is your law. <br>
MAAB: We will honour our law, and our word to you, Klingon. <br>
KEEL: Maab. <br>
ELEEN: The child is dead, Maab. Do as you will with me. <br>
KEEL: The Earthmen? <br>
ELEEN: Dead. I killed them as they slept. <br>
KRAS: If true, take us to them. <br>
ELEEN: Do you doubt my word, Klingon? I'm the wife of a teer. I will
die in my own tent. <br>
MAAB: It is in order. She is the wife of a teer. (Kras runs off.) No! <br>
KRAS: First, we'll verify her story. <br>
MAAB: Is this what your sworn word means, Klingon? <br>
(Kirk shoots an arrow into Kras' knee. A kligat is thrown, and Spock
shoots the thrower. Kirk downs another. Eleen runs for the Klingon's
phaser but he picks it up first and uses it to blast at Spock's hiding
place.) <br>
KIRK: Spock. Spock! <br>
SPOCK: Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. (into communicator as Kirk
joins him.) Spock to Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time
anymore. <br>
SPOCK: If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I
must agree. <br>
MAAB: Naam. <br>
(But Kras disintegrates him before he can throw his kligat) <br>
KIRK: There's just one thing I want. <br>
SPOCK: The Klingon? <br>
KIRK: One of us must get him. <br>
SPOCK: Revenge, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Why not? <br>
KRAS: The next man who raises a weapon destroys all of you. You and
your primitive knives and your weapons, I'll teach you what killing
really means. <br>
KIRK: Klingon! <br>
ELEEN: Fight! Are you warriors or children? Maab, I will flee. When the
Klingon turns to fire, I'll <br>

your life. Mine is now forfeit. Keel, stand ready. <br>
(Maab walks forward, arms out to the side.) <br>
MAAB: Klingon! <br>
(Kras disintegrates him, and Keel throws his kligat, killing Kras. The
two factions gather at the body. Then a bunch of red-shirts run around
the corner.)<br>
SCOTT: Hold it there. Drop your weapons. <br>
(McCoy arrives carrying the baby, and Eleen goes to him.) <br>
KIRK: We missed you, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Well sir, we had a wee bit of a run-in with a Klingon vessel,
but he had no stomach for fighting. We checked the encampment, found
out you were here, and had no trouble at all in tracking you down. I
could <br>

MCCOY: No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take
his little head like that. There, arm in a. That's it. See how easy?
Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. <br>
SPOCK: Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain? <br>
KIRK: An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.
If you're curious, consult linguistics. <br>
SPOCK: Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting. <br>
KIRK: Interesting? <br>
SPOCK: When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is
actually Doctor McCoy's child. <br>
SCOTT: What's that again, Mister Spock? <br>
KIRK: We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott. <br>

SPOCK: The child was named Leonard James Akaar? <br>
MCCOY: Has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, James? <br>
KIRK: Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history,
Leonard. What do you think, Spock? <br>

yourselves for at least a month, sir. <br>

PALMER: The distress call definitely came from one of the solar systems
in this sector. <br>
KIRK: Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant? <br>
PALMER: Negative. It was so badly garbled all we got was the name
Constellation, then we lost it. <br>
SULU: Sir, we're now within the limits of System L-370, but I can't
seem to locate <br>
SPOCK: Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been
destroyed. Nothing left but rubble and asteroids. <br>
KIRK: But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact.
Only a nova could destroy like that. <br>
SPOCK: Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we
charted seven planets last year. <br>
KIRK: Continue a search pattern. <br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
(Later.) <br>
SULU: Entering limits of System L-374, sir. Scanners show the same
evidence of destruction. <br>
KIRK: Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no
sign of the Constellation. Matt Decker's in command. What could have
happened to him? <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be
intact. <br>
PALMER: Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon. <br>
KIRK: Try to raise it, Lieutenant. <br>
SPOCK: I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship
stopped in space. She appears to be drifting. <br>
PALMER: No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon. <br>
SPOCK: Sensors not recording normal energy output. <br>
KIRK: Approach course, Mister Sulu. <br>
(They arrive at a ship hanging crookedly in space. It looks identical
to Enterprise.) <br>
KIRK: It's the Constellation. Look at that. <br>
SPOCK: She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar
systems. <br>
KIRK: She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations!
<br>
PALMER: Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations. <br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu? <br>
SULU: All phaser banks manned and ready, sir. <br>
KIRK: Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for
any other vessel. <br>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Palmer. <br>
PALMER: I can't raise the Constellation, sir. I'm still getting the
distress beacon, but there's heavy subspace interference. It's almost
blocking the signal. <br>
KIRK: Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the
Constellation. <br>
SPOCK: All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very
low power level. <br>
KIRK: Life support systems? <br>
SPOCK: Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is
damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain
life. <br>
KIRK: Radiation levels? <br>
SPOCK: Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult. <br>
SULU: No other vessels in the area, Captain. All scanners show clear. <br>
KIRK: All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations.
Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, and a damage control party
report to me in the transporter room. <br>
PALMER: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command. <br>
SPOCK: Acknowledged. </font></p>

SCOTT: Captain, I've checked the engines. The warp drive is a hopeless
pile of junk. The impulse engines are not too badly off. We ought to be
able to do something with them. <br>
KIRK: Phaser banks? <br>
SCOTT: Exhausted. They didn't give up without a battle. <br>
KIRK: But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker
abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative. <br>
SCOTT: Computer system is still intact. We can playback the duplicate

DECKER: That <br>
KIRK: Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt? <br>
MCCOY: Jim, give him a minute. He's in a state of shock. <br>
SCOTT: Ready with the duplicate log, sir. <br>
KIRK: Go. <br>
DECKER [OC]: Captain's log, stardate 4202.1. Exceptionally heavy
subspace interference still prevents our contacting Starfleet
to inform them of the destroyed solar systems we have encountered. We
are now entering system L-374. Science Officer Masada reports the
fourth planet seems to be breaking up. We are going to investigate. <br>
KIRK: The fourth planet. Only two left now. Scotty, pull the microtapes
from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock. I want a
full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on
that planet. <br>
DECKER: We tried to contact Starfleet. No one heard. No one! We
couldn't run. <br>
KIRK: What happened to your crew? <br>
DECKER: Oh, I had to beam them down. We were dead. No power, our
phasers useless. I stayed behind, the last man. The Captain, the last
man aboard the ship. That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it? And
then it hit again and the transporter went out. They were down there,
and I'm up here. <br>
KIRK: What hit? What attacked you? <br>
DECKER: They say there's no devil, Jim, but there is. Right out of
hell, I saw it. <br>
KIRK: Matt, where's your crew? <br>
DECKER: On the third planet. <br>
KIRK: There is no third planet. <br>
DECKER: Don't you think I know that? There was, but not anymore. They
called me. They begged me for help, four hundred of them. I couldn't.
I couldn't. (breaks down in tears) <br>
SCOTT: Captain, Washburn has our report. <br>
KIRK: Go. <br>
WASHBURN: We made a complete check on structural and control damage,
sir. As far as we can tell, something crashed through the deflectors
and knocked out the generators. Somehow the antimatter in the warp
drive pods has been deactivated. <br>
KIRK: Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening
field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy
subspace interference? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, that all adds up. But what sort of a thing could do all
that? <br>
DECKER: If you'd seen it, you'd know. The whole thing's a weapon. It
must be. <br>
KIRK: What does it look like? <br>
DECKER: Well, it's miles long, with a maw that could swallow a dozen
starships. It destroys planets, chops them into rubble. <br>
KIRK: What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it <br>
DECKER: Both or neither. I don't know. <br>
KIRK: Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You
went in to investigate. <br>
DECKER: We saw this thing hovering over the planet, slicing out chunks
of it with a force beam. <br>
KIRK: Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam? <br>
DECKER: Pure antiproton. Absolutely pure. <br>

computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as
a base course.
Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside,
from another galaxy. <br>
KIRK [OC]: What is the projected course of this thing? <br>

MCCOY: But why? <br>
KIRK: Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine? <br>
MCCOY: No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic. <br>
KIRK: It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be
used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like
the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A
doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago.
They don't exist anymore, but the machine is still destroying. <br>

assuming command of the Enterprise. <br>

going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range. <br>

alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states <br>
MCCOY: To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when
you know he's wrong! <br>
SPOCK: If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically
unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C. <br>

SPOCK: You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove
it. <br>

gambling your life on, sir. <br>
KIRK: What about the detonator? <br>
SCOTT: I've linked it in with the impulse control system. (flips a
switch) It's armed now. Press this one.
Thirty seconds later, poof! Once it's activated, there's no way to stop
it. <br>

much as possible. Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite
repairs on the warp drive. Poor Matt. He gave his life in an attempt to
save others. Not the worst way to go. <br>
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. I presume your log will show that Commodore
Decker died in the line of duty. <br>
KIRK: Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the
20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday
machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday
machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for
constructive purposes. <br>
SPOCK: Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there
are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe. <br>
KIRK: Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient. </font>

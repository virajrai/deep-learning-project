KIRK: Good. Mister Chekov, this flight is supposed to provide both
experience and knowledge. How close will we come to the Klingon outpost
if we continue on our present course? <br>
CHEKOV: One parsec, sir. Close enough to smell them. <br>
SPOCK: That is illogical, Ensign. Odours cannot travel through the
vacuum of space. <br>
CHEKOV: I was making a little joke, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Extremely little, Ensign. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant? <br>
SPOCK: Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The
battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years
ago. Inconclusive. <br>
KIRK: Analysis of disputed area? <br>
SPOCK: Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our
Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim. <br>
CHEKOV: The area was first mapped by the famous Russian astronomer Ivan
Borkoff almost two hundred <br>

CHEKOV: Burke, sir? I don't think so. I'm sure it was <br>
SPOCK: John Burke was the Chief Astronomer at the Royal Academy in old
Britain at the time. <br>
CHEKOV: Oh, Royal Academy. Well <br>
KIRK: is the rest of your history that faulty, Ensign? Key points of
dispute? <br>
CHEKOV: Under terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, one side or the other
must prove it can develop the planet most efficiently. <br>
KIRK: And unfortunately, though the Klingons are brutal and aggressive,
they are most efficient. <br>

LURRY [OC]: Well, perhaps you better beam over. I'll try to explain. <br>

KIRK: Mister Lurry, if there's no emergency, why did you issue a
priority one distress call? <br>
BARIS: That was my order, Captain. <br>
LURRY: Captain Kirk, this is Nilz Baris. He's out from Earth to take
charge of the development project on Sherman's Planet. <br>
KIRK: And that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on
defence alert? <br>
DARVIN: Mister Baris is the Federation Undersecretary in Charge of
Agricultural Affairs in this quadrant. <br>
SPOCK; That gives him the authority. <br>
KIRK: Oh. <br>
BARIS: This is my assistant Arne Darvin. <br>
KIRK: And this is my first officer Mister Spock. <br>
LURRY: Mister Spock. <br>
BARIS: And now Captain, I want all available security guards. I want
them posted around the storage compartments. <br>
KIRK: Storage compartments? Storage compartments? <br>
DARVIN: The storage compartments containing the quadrotriticale. <br>
KIRK: What? What? What's quadrotriticale? (Lurry hands him a small
packet) Wheat. So what? <br>
BARIS: Quadrotriticale is not wheat, Captain. Of course, I wouldn't
expect you or Mister Spock to know about such things, but
quadrotriticale is a rather <br>
SPOCK: Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of
wheat and rye. A perennial, also, I believe. Its root grain, triticale,
can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century Canada <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, you've made your point. <br>
LURRY: Quadrotriticale is the only earth grain that grows on Sherman's
Planet. We have several tons of it here on the station. It's very
important that grain gets to Sherman's Planet safely. Mister Baris
thinks that Klingon agents may try to sabotage it. <br>
KIRK: You issued a priority one distress call for a couple of tons of
wheat? <br>
DARVIN: Quadrotriticale! <br>
BARIS: Of course, Captain, I realise that <br>
KIRK: Mister Baris, you summoned the Enterprise without an emergency.
You'll take full responsibility for it. <br>
BARIS: What do you mean? <br>
SPOCK: Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence. <br>
BARIS: I did not misuse the Priority One channel. I want that grain
protected. <br>
LURRY: Captain, couldn't you at least post a couple of guards? We do
have a large number of ships passing through. <br>
SPOCK: It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's
Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Enterprise here. <br>
KIRK: Secure from general quarters. And beam down two, and only two,
security guards. Have them report to Mister Lurry.
Authorise shore leave for all off-duty personnel. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Kirk out. <br>
BARIS: Captain Kirk, how dare you authorise a mere two men for a
project of this importance? Starfleet Command <br>

representative of the Federation. Until now. <br>

can see for yourself how much the lovely little lady appreciates the
finer things. <br>
BARMAN: One credit apiece. <br>
CHEKOV: He won't bite, will he? <br>
JONES: Sir, transporting harmful animals from one planet to another is
against regulations, or weren't you aware of that? Besides, tribbles
have no teeth. <br>
BARMAN: All right. I'll double my offer 2 credits. <br>
JONES: Twice nothing is still nothing. <br>
UHURA: If you're not going to take him, I'm going to take him. I think
he's cute. <br>

JONES: You're an honest man. I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm
going to lessen my price to eight and a half credits. <br>

a credit more. <br>

JONES: Right away. <br>

BARMAN: Well, let me see, little lady. Six credits. Figure a reasonable
mark-up for a reasonable profit, say ten percent mark-up. Ten credits. <br>
JONES: Thief. <br>

KIRK: I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All
right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it.
Dismissed. (the men file out) Scotty, not you. You were supposed to
prevent trouble, Mister Scott. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Who threw the first punch, Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: Um. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott? <br>
SCOTT: I did, Captain. <br>
KIRK: You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: They insulted us, sir. <br>
KIRK: Must have been some insult. <br>
SCOTT: Aye, it was. <br>
KIRK: You threw the first punch. <br>
SCOTT: Aye. Chekov wanted to, but I held him back. <br>
KIRK: You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight? <br>
SCOTT: Well, the Klingon, sir. Is this off the record? <br>
KIRK: No, this is not off the record. <br>
SCOTT: Well, Captain, the Klingons called you, uh a tin-plated,
overbearing, swaggering dictator with delusions of godhood. <br>
KIRK: Is that all? <br>
SCOTT: No, sir. They also compared you with a Denebian slime devil. <br>
KIRK: I see. <br>
SCOTT: And then they said you <br>
KIRK: I get the picture, Scotty. <br>
SCOTT: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons? <br>
SCOTT: No, sir. <br>
KIRK: No? <br>
SCOTT: No, I didn't. You told us to avoid trouble. <br>
KIRK: Oh, yes. <br>
SCOTT: And I didn't see that it was worth fighting about. After all,
we're big enough to take a few insults. Aren't we? <br>
KIRK: What was it they said that started the fight? <br>
SCOTT: They called the Enterprise a garbage scow, sir. <br>
KIRK: I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons? <br>
SCOTT: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not
because they <br>
SCOTT: Well, sir, this was a matter of pride. <br>
KIRK: All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to
quarters until further notice. <br>
SCOTT: (big grin) Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. That'll give me a chance to
catch up on my technical journals.

MCCOY: What's the matter, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: There's something disquieting about these creatures. <br>
MCCOY: Don't tell me you've got a feeling. <br>
SPOCK: Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the
field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a
great deal. I see no practical use for them. <br>
MCCOY: Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're
nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound. <br>
SPOCK: So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one.
<br>
MCCOY: It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially
if they're attractive in some way. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am
frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with
practically anything. <br>
MCCOY: Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet,
but there's one thing that I have discovered. <br>
SPOCK: What is that, Doctor? <br>

conversation. When he sits, there is a squeak. He has sat on a large
tribble. Then he notices that there are fluffy balls everywhere.) <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? (he takes a
walk around then) Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on
the bridge? <br>
UHURA: I don't know, sir. They do seem to be all over the ship. <br>
(McCoy enters, stroking a tribble.) <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy. <br>
MCCOY: Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the
tribbles who are breeding. If we don't get them off this ship, we're
going to be hip deep in them. <br>
KIRK: Explain that. <br>
MCCOY: The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant,
which seems to be quite a time saver. <br>
KIRK: I know, but really <br>
MCCOY: And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing
at will. And, brother, have they got a lot of will. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running
computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an
alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning
nothing. <br>
UHURA: But they do give us something, Mister Spock. They give us love.
Well, Cyrano Jones says a tribble is the only love that money can buy. <br>
KIRK: Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a
good thing. <br>
UHURA: Yes, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then
contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye. <br>
KIRK: Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him. <br>
UHURA: Aye. <br>
KIRK: And get these tribbles off the bridge. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JONES: Captain Kirk, I'm mystified at your tone of
voice. I've done nothing to warrant such severe treatment. <br>
KIRK: Oh, really? <br>
SPOCK: Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed
the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment
where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no
restraining factors. <br>
JONES: Of course. What did you say? <br>
SPOCK: By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have,
so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to
escape. <br>
JONES: If by that, you mean do they breed quickly? Of course, that's
how I maintain my stock. Breeding animals is not against regulations,
only breeding dangerous ones. And tribbles are not dangerous. <br>
KIRK: Just incredibly prolific. <br>
JONES: Precisely, and at six credits a head, well, that is, a body, it
mounts up. Now if you'll excuse me. <br>
KIRK: You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this
thing. <br>
JONES: If I did, what would happen to man's search for knowledge? Well,
I must be tending my ship. Au revoir. <br>
(He meets Baris and Darvin at the door.) <br>
DARVIN: Go ahead, sir. Tell him. <br>
BARIS: Captain Kirk, I consider your security measures a disgrace. In
my opinion, you have taken this important project far too lightly. <br>
KIRK: On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important.
It is you I take lightly. <br>
BARIS: I am going to report fully to the proper authorities that you
have given free and complete access to this station to a man who is
quite probably a Klingon agent. <br>
KIRK: That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring? <br>
BARIS: To that man who just walked out of here. <br>
KIRK: Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent? <br>
BARIS: You heard me. <br>
KIRK: I heard you. <br>
SPOCK: He simply could not believe his ears. <br>
KIRK: What evidence do you have against Mister Jones? <br>
BARIS: My assistant here has kept Mister Jones under close surveillance
for quite some time, and his actions have been most suspicious. I
believe he was involved in that little altercation between your men and
the men from <br>
KIRK: Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have? <br>
DARVIN: Well Captain, I've checked his ship's log, and it seems that he
was within the Klingon's sphere of influence less than four months ago.
<br>
BARIS: The man is an independent scout, Captain. It is quite possible
he is also a Klingon spy. <br>
SPOCK: We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano
Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never
broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with
his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in
the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately,
tribbles. <br>
BARIS: But he is after my grain! <br>
KIRK: Do you have any proof of that? <br>
DARVIN: You can't deny he's disrupted this station. <br>
KIRK: People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon
agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris.
Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence. Now, if
you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to. Au revoir.

SPOCK: Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man

SCOTT: They're into the machinery, all right, and they're probably in
all the other food processors too. <br>

SCOTT: Probably through one of the air vents. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station. <br>

instead. That does open, and a whole load of tribbles fall out, burying
the gallant Captain up to his shoulders. Spock examines one.) <br>

BARIS: Gorged? On my grain? Kirk, I am going to hold you responsible.
There must be thousands of them. <br>
KIRK: Hundreds of thousands. <br>
SPOCK: One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred
sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average
litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a
period of three days. <br>
KIRK: That's assuming they got here three days ago. <br>
SPOCK: And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of
the storage compartment. <br>
BARIS: Kirk, you should have known. You are responsible for turning the

you have ignored me, you've walked all over me. You have abused your

them. We quit feeding them, they stop breeding. <br>

SPOCK: Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these. <br>
MCCOY: A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't
be for long. <br>
SPOCK: The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain. <br>
KIRK: Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed.
I want to know what killed these tribbles. <br>
MCCOY: I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I
find out anything, I'll let you know. (leaves) <br>
BARIS: That isn't going to do you any good, Kirk. This project is
ruined, and Starfleet is going to hear about it. And when they do, they
will have a board of inquiry and they will roast you alive. And I am
going to be there, Kirk, to enjoy every minute of it. <br>
KIRK: Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want
two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second (as another
tribble hits him on the head) close that door.

KOLOTH: Captain Kirk! <br>
KIRK: What do you want? <br>
KOLOTH: An official apology addressed to the Klingon High Command. I
expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of Klingon
nationals in this quadrant. <br>
KIRK: An apology? <br>
KOLOTH: Yes. You've harassed my men. You've treated them like
criminals. You've been most uncourteous, Captain Kirk. If you wish to
avoid a diplomatic incident <br>
BARIS: No, Kirk. You can't let him. That will give them the wedge they
need to claim Sherman's Planet. <br>
SPOCK: I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon
commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris. <br>
KOLOTH: Mister Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain
Kirk has already given it to us. <br>
KIRK: Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official
action, I'd like to know Just what happened. Who put the tribbles in
the quadrotriticale? What was in the grain that killed them? <br>
KOLOTH: Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request? <br>
KIRK: Yes. <br>
KOLOTH: Can you get those things out of here? <br>
(The guards take Jones' tribbles from him. They get to the door as
Darvin enters, and the tribbles shriek.) <br>
SPOCK: Remarkable. <br>
KIRK: Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody. <br>
JONES: They do. I can't understand it. The last time I saw one act this
way was at the bar. <br>

JONES: Klingons. Him, for one. (points at Korax) <br>
(Kirk takes two tribbles from the guards and brings them near Korax.

KIRK: You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. (McCoy
enters) But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you. <br>

KIRK: Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no
accounting for taste. (and back to Darvin) They don't like you, Mister
Darvin. I wonder why. Bones? <br>
MCCOY: (scanning him) Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is.
Jim, this man is a Klingon. <br>
BARIS: A Klingon? <br>
KIRK: I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about
the grain, Bones? <br>
MCCOY: Oh, yes. It was poisoned. <br>
BARIS: Poisoned? <br>
MCCOY: Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an
inert material in the bloodstream. The more the organism eats, the more
inert matter is built up. So after two or three days, they reached a
point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive. <br>
KIRK: They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain,
they starved to death. <br>
MCCOY: That is essentially it. <br>
KIRK: Mister Darvin, are you going to talk? <br>
DARVIN: I have nothing to say. (Kirk thrusts the tribbles into his
face) All right, I poisoned the grain! Take them away. <br>
KIRK: And the tribbles had nothing to do with it? <br>
DARVIN: I don't know. I never saw one before in my life, and I hope I
never see one of those fuzzy miserable things again. <br>
BARIS: I'm certain that can be arranged, Darvin. Guards? If you'll
excuse me, Captain. <br>

what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human
life? <br>

do a thing like that to me, now would you? Would you? <br>
SPOCK: The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony. <br>

sort of mutual understanding. After all, my tribbles did put you wise
to the poisoned grain, and they did help you to find the Klingon agent.
You saved a lot of lives that way. <br>
KIRK: There is one thing you can do. <br>

KIRK: Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll
speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship. <br>

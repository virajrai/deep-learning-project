Captain's log, stardate 5730.2. The planet Ariannus is vital as a
transfer point on regular space commercial lanes. It has been attacked
by a bacterial invasion which threatens to render it lifeless unless
checked. Our mission, to decontaminate it.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Mister Chekov, our estimated time of arrival
for Ariannus? <br>
CHEKOV: At present speed, our eta is three hours, four minutes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health that
we'll begin decontamination procedures immediately upon locking into
orbit. <br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, will that present any problems for you? <br>
SCOTT: None, sir. All tanks are being positioned. <br>
SULU: Captain, sensors indicate a space vehicle of some sort ahead. <br>
KIRK: Is it within visual range? <br>
SULU: Coming into range now, sir. It's following a very erratic course.
<br>
KIRK: Put it on the screen, extreme magnification. <br>
(A wobbly shuttlecraft appears on the viewscreen.) <br>
CHEKOV: I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft. <br>
SPOCK: That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov. <br>
SULU: It looks like the one reported stolen from Starbase Four two
weeks ago. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency two. <br>
UHURA: Aye, Captain. No response, sir. <br>
KIRK: Try all frequencies. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. Hailing on all frequencies. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, there is one living creature aboard. Humanoid. He is
either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage.
The creature may be suffocating. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Sulu, activate tractor beams. <br>
SULU: Tractor beams activated. We have it, sir. <br>
KIRK: Prepare to bring it aboard the hangar deck. <br>
SULU: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, send a security team to the pressure doors on
the hangar deck. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, come with me. Scotty. <br>
(Scott takes the conn.)

SPOCK: You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural
condition of this individual? <br>
MCCOY: That's what I've recorded, Mister Spock. <br>
KIRK: Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced
such a race of beings? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Bones, what do you make of it? <br>
MCCOY: Well, I can't give you any specific circumstance that will
explain him. <br>
KIRK: And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is
the result of a very dramatic conflict. Spock? <br>
SPOCK: There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to
recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All
gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are
genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is
that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind. <br>
MCCOY: Yes, I would agree. That's the case here. <br>
KIRK: Your prognosis, Doctor? <br>
MCCOY: Well, I can't give you one, Jim. I've never worked on anyone
like him or anything like him. <br>
SPOCK: Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he
were a human. <br>
MCCOY: When in doubt, the book prevails, Mister Spock. I've run tests.
Blood is blood, even when it's green like yours.
The organs are there. They're rearranged to a degree, plus a few I've
never seen before. Now, I've enriched the oxygen content of his blood
and pumped in a strong stimulant. And I must say his recuperative
powers appear to be excellent.
<br>SPOCK: With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research
and join you on the bridge. <br>
)Spock leaves.) <br>
CHAPEL: He's coming around, Doctor. <br>
MCCOY: Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger
now. <br>
KIRK: You're aboard the starship Enterprise. <br>
LOKAI: I've heard of it. It's in the United Fleet of Planets? <br>
KIRK: Federation. So was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in. <br>
LOKAI: It was? <br>
KIRK: Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen? <br>
LOKAI: I am not a thief. <br>
KIRK: Well, certainly no ordinary thief, considering what it is you
appropriated. <br>
LOKAI: You're being very loose with your accusations and drawing
conclusions without any facts. <br>
KIRK: Well, I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to
you. <br>
LOKAI: I do not make off with things. My need gave me the right to use
the ship. Mark the word, sir, the use of it. <br>
KIRK: You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command. That's
where you'll be facing your charges. <br>
LOKAI: I'm grateful for your rescue. <br>
KIRK: Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you. Who are you? <br>
LOKAI: My name is Lokai. <br>
KIRK: Go on. <br>
LOKAI: From the planet Cheron. <br>
KIRK: That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an uncharted
quarter. What are you doing so far from home? (no answer) You
understand that when we complete our mission, we'll take you to
Starbase where you'll face a very serious charge. <br>
LOKAI: The charge is trifling. I would've returned the ship as soon as
I <br>
KIRK: Had what? What were you going to do? <br>
LOKAI: You monotone humans are all alike. First you condemn and then
attack. I will answer no more questions. <br>
MCCOY: Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary
specimen. Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I
had your readings, I'd be the most incredible physical specimen of all
time. <br>
KIRK: We've never encountered a being like you. I'd like to know more
about you and your planet. <br>
LOKAI: I'm very tired. <br>
KIRK: And very evasive. Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then, <br>
LOKAI: I insist, I'm extremely tired. Made so by your vindictive
cross-examinations. I will answer no more questions. <br>
(Kirk goes to a desk monitor.) <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Lieutenant Uhura here. <br>
KIRK: Notify Starbase Four that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and
it will be returned along with its user as soon as we've completed our
mission at Ariannus. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is
applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report. <br>
MCCOY: Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve. <br>
(Intercom whistle) <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Captain, contact with alien ship, sir. <br>
KIRK: I'll be right there. Notify Mister Spock.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mister
Sulu. Magnification. Still nothing, Mister Chekov. <br>
CHEKOV: I verify, sir, it's out there. <br>
KIRK: Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your
response? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. <br>
CHEKOV: No malfunction, sir. The reading persists. <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: There is a vessel out there, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device? <br>
SPOCK: Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally
alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft
indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew. <br>
UHURA: Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies. Negative, sir. <br>
KIRK: Weaponry on the vessel, Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed
rather than combat. <br>
KIRK: Something out there can't be seen. Explanation? <br>
SPOCK: None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible. <br>
KIRK: Invisible. Malfunction? <br>
SPOCK: There is no sensor failure. The readings persist. <br>
CHEKOV: It's headed straight for us! <br>
KIRK: Evasive action. <br>
CHEKOV: It shifts with us, sir. And we're pushing to the limit! <br>
KIRK: Deflector shields activated, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Automatic, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: We're on collision course. <br>
SULU: It's out of control or a suicide mission. <br>
KIRK: Sound warning for collision. Red Alert. <br>
SULU: Brace yourself for collision. Brace yourself. <br>
(Nothing happens.) <br>
KIRK: Read out, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: It just disintegrated. Fascinating. <br>
KIRK: What is it now? <br>
SPOCK: It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien
presence. <br>
KIRK: Where? <br>
BELE: Right here, Captain. <br>
(By the turbolift doors is a man, white on the left side, black on the
right.) <br>
KIRK: Explain, Spock. One of a kind? <br>
BELE: I am Bele. <br>
KIRK: Of the planet Cheron, no doubt. <br>
BELE: Forgive my unorthodox arrival. <br>
KIRK: Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert.
What happened to your vehicle? <br>
BELE: It served me long and durably. Unfortunately, the strain of
arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities. I was just
able to complete this trip and disembark in time, or I would have
disintegrated in space with it. <br>
SPOCK: A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.
<br>
BELE: Yes. It was sheathed in special materials that rendered it
invisible. <br>
KIRK: What brings you to us? <br>
BELE: You bear precious cargo, Lokai. He has taken refuge aboard this
ship. I am here to claim him. <br>
KIRK: All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command. No
one claims anyone without due process. <br>
BELE: My apologies, Captain. I overstepped my powers. Claim is
undoubtedly an unfortunate word. <br>
KIRK: What is your authorisation? From what source? <br>
BELE: I am chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors. Lokai
was tried and convicted of treason, but had escaped. May I see him,
please? <br>
KIRK: He's in Sickbay. Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise,
you're bound by its regulations. <br>
BELE: With your permission, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sickbay]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BELE: Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you
again. This time I'm sure our joining will be of a more permanent
nature.
Captain, you are to be congratulated. Never before has Lokai been
rendered so quiescent. <br>
LOKAI: I will not return to Cheron with him, to a land of murdering
oppressors! <br>
KIRK: I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman
here simply as a courtesy. <br>
BELE: And you see how this killer repays you, as he repays all his
benefactors. <br>
LOKAI: Benefactors? He's a liar. He raided our homes, tore us from our
families, herded us together like cattle and then sold us as slaves! <br>
BELE: They were savages, Captain. We took them into our hearts, our
homes. We educated them. <br>
LOKAI: Yes, just education enough to serve the master race. <br>
BELE: You were the product of our love! And you repaid us with murder. <br>
LOKAI: Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver? <br>
BELE: Slaves? That was changed thousands of years ago. You were freed. <br>
LOKAI: Freed? Were we free to be men? Free to be husbands and fathers?
Free to live our lives in equality and dignity? <br>
BELE: Yes, you were free, if you knew how to use your freedom. You were
free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been
built! <br>
LOKAI: I tried to break the chains of a hundred million people. My only
crime is that I failed. To that I do plead guilty. <br>
BELE: There is an order in things. He asked for utopia in a day. It
can't be done. <br>
LOKAI: Not in a day. And not in ten times ten thousand years by your
thinking. To you, we are a loathsome breed who will never be ready.
Genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia. <br>
BELE: You insane, you filthy little plotter of ruin. You vicious
subverter of every decent thought. Oh, you're coming back to pay for
your crimes! <br>
LOKAI: I know you and all those with whom you're plotting to take power
permanently. When I return to Cheron, you will understand what power
is. I will have armies of followers. <br>
KIRK: It's now very clear you know each other extremely well,
gentlemen. The only service this ship can offer is to bring you
together. It is not a battlefield. <br>
LOKAI: Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals. I demand
political asylum. This ship is a sanctuary. <br>
KIRK: I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison. <br>
BELE: Captain, it is imperative that you return Lokai to Cheron for
judgment. <br>
KIRK: Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No
treaties have ever been signed. Your demand for possession of this
prisoner cannot be honoured. There are no extradition procedures to
allow it. Is that clear, Commissioner Bele? <br>
BELE: Captain, I hope you will be sensible. <br>
KIRK: How do you mean? <br>
BELE: Co-operation. <br>
KIRK: I cannot take sides. <br>
BELE: Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron, I insist that
you take us there immediately. <br>
KIRK: Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to
be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake. Once that has been
completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the
authorities. You can make your case to them. <br>
BELE: I am sorry, Captain. That will not be satisfactory, not at all
satisfactory. <br>
KIRK: Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer
you every hospitality aboard this ship.
Choose any other course, <br>
BELE: You're the captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least
for the present. I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six. <br>
(Bele leaves with a security escort.) <br>
KIRK: And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal
chords. It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your
oratory on Starbase Four. <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Chekov to Captain Kirk. Chekov to Captain Kirk. Urgent. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
CHEKOV [OC]: Captain, we're off course. <br>

been helped to escape. On every planet he's found fools who bleed for
him and shed tears for the oppressed one. But there is no escape for
you on this ship. This is your last sanctuary. <br>

other choice possible. <br>

now controls this, and nothing can break it. <br>

course I set for it, or I will order its destruction. <br>

the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise
of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long
since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are
free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to

LOKAI: You speak very well, Captain. Your words promise justice for
all. <br>
KIRK: We try, sir. <br>
LOKAI: Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions. After Ariannus,
what is justice? I shall wait to see it dispensed. <br>
(Lokai leaves) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids. <br>
SCOTT: Disgusting is what I call them. <br>
SPOCK: That description is not scientifically accurate. <br>
SCOTT: Mister Spock, the word disgusting describes exactly what I feel
about those two. <br>
KIRK: That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rec room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Crew are sitting at tables, not playing chess,
while Lokai expounds his case. Spock and we are listening from
outside.) <br>
LOKAI: And I know from my actions you must all think me a volcanic
hothead, erupting lava from my nostrils at danger signals that are only
figments of my imagination. But believe me, my friends, there can be no
moment when I can have my guard down where such as Bele is present. So
what happens? I act the madman out of the anger and frustration he
forces upon me, and thereby prove his point that I am a madman. <br>
SULU: No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai. <br>
CHEKOV: After all, we are only human. <br>
LOKAI: Ah, Mister Chekov, therein lies my lack of ability to alert you
and your captain to the real threat of someone like Bele. You see, you
are from the planet Earth. There is no persecution on your planet. How
can you understand my fear,
my apprehension, my degradation, my suffering? <br>
CHEKOV: There was persecution on Earth once. I remember reading about
it in my history class. <br>
SULU: Yes, but it happened way back in the twentieth century. There's
no such primitive thinking today. <br>
LOKAI: You have read about it in history, I see. How can I make your
flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you, and only
because they are like you, despised, slaughtered, and even worse,
denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living being's right? Do
you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel into a
war on another planet? A battle that will serve your oppressor and
bring death to you and your brothers?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BELE: Putting the matter into the hands of your
Starfleet Command is, of course, the proper procedure. How long will it
be before we hear from them, Captain? <br>
KIRK: I expect the answer is already on its way. <br>
BELE: Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem. <br>
KIRK: Let's do that. <br>
SPOCK: Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution
you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai
appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount
importance to Starfleet. <br>
BELE: Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree. Surely,
stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of
murdering thousands of people. <br>
SPOCK: We do not know that Lokai has done that. <br>
BELE: One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal. <br>
KIRK: No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai
took a shuttlecraft. <br>
(Intercom whistle) <br>
KIRK: Excuse me. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Uhura to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. <br>
UHURA [OC]: I have a communication from Starfleet Command, sir. <br>
KIRK: Yes, read it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA: Starfleet Command extends greetings to
Commissioner Bele of the planet Cheron. His urgent request to be
transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been
taken under consideration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Captain's mess]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UHURA [OC]: It is with great regret that we cannot
honour that request. Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies that no
being can be extradited without due process. In view of the
circumstances, we have no doubt that after a hearing at Starbase,
Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner and be
provided transportation <br>
KIRK: That's enough. Thank you. <br>
BELE: As always, Lokai has managed to gain allies. <br>
KIRK: Now, wait a minute, Commissioner, <br>
BELE: Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such. Yes, he
will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process put thousands of
innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim
for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them
to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his
loathsome accusations and his foul threats. <br>
KIRK: I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be
twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you. <br>
BELE: It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an
inferior breed. <br>
SPOCK: The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the
same breed as yourself. <br>
BELE: Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me. Look at me! <br>
KIRK: You're black on one side and white on the other. <br>
BELE: I am black on the right side. <br>
KIRK: I fail to see the significant difference. <br>
BELE: Lokai is white on the right side. All of his people are white on
the right side. <br>
SPOCK: Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may
set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being
destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to
destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly
emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view,
leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of
logic saved my planet from extinction. <br>
BELE: Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved, but you
cannot expect Lokai and people like him to act with self-discipline any
more than you can expect a planet to stop orbiting its sun. <br>
KIRK: Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he
can change. Maybe he wants to change his image. <br>
BELE: He cannot change. <br>
SPOCK: Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance,
the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured. <br>
BELE: You mean like both of you? <br>
KIRK: There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was
true. <br>
(Intercom whistle)<br>
KIRK: Excuse me. Kirk here. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: We're orbiting Ariannus, sir. <br>
KIRK: Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise
when complete. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: At once, sir. Scott out. <br>
BELE: I once heard that on some of your planets people believe they are
descended from apes. <br>
SPOCK: The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower
levels to the more advanced stages.

for Starbase Four as ordered. I can't get a response. <br>
UHURA: It just seemed to go dead, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned
out. <br>
KIRK: Can you determine which ones? <br>

KIRK: At the moment, I seem to have no choice. <br>
LOKAI: So this is justice after Ariannus! You have signed my death
warrant. I warned you what to expect. Will you continue to let this
mockery of justice go on? If you are partisans of justice, prove it!
Kill him! <br>
CHEKOV: We are not killers. <br>
LOKAI: What do you do, carry justice on your tongues? You will beg for
it, but you won't fight or die for it.
<br>KIRK: After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much
alive. <br>
SPOCK: I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers. <br>
BELE: You're finished, Lokai! We've got your kind penned in on Cheron
into little districts, and it's not going to change. You've combed the
galaxy and come up with nothing but mono-coloured trash, do-gooders and
bleeding hearts. You're dead, you half-white! <br>
LOKAI: You useless pieces of bland flesh. I'll take you with me, you
half-black. <br>
(They lunge for each others throats, and send off electrical charges.) <br>
KIRK: Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your
prisoner. The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged. This will
be your final battlefield. Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will
have been wasted. <br>
(Bele and Lokai separate) <br>
KIRK: And you, Lokai, will die here in space. You'll inspire no more
disciples. Your cause will be ended. <br>
LOKAI: Remember, Captain, political sanctuary is my right. I am your
prisoner. Honour that right, or the fight will go on and your ship will
burn up. <br>
KIRK: You've made your point. <br>
BELE: If you listen to his legalistic trickery, I shall have to destroy
this ship and everybody aboard. <br>
KIRK: I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control? <br>
BELE: Why not? <br>
KIRK: Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed? <br>
SCOTT: Aye, sir. Re-routed. <br>
KIRK: Check controls and co-ordinates. <br>
SULU: Controls operating. The Enterprise is responding as always.
Captain, it's beautiful. <br>
CHEKOV: Locking onto co-ordinates. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron. <br>
KIRK: Is it within visual range? <br>
SPOCK: Coming within visual range now, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you
picking up? <br>
SPOCK: Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems,
barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the
cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no
evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied
corpses in all cities. <br>
KIRK: You mean, all the people are dead? <br>
SPOCK: All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally. <br>
BELE: My people, all dead? <br>
KIRK: Yes, Commissioner, all of them. <br>
LOKAI: No one alive? <br>
SPOCK: None at all, sir. <br>
BELE: Your band of murderers did this. <br>
LOKAI: Your genocidal maniacs did this! <br>
(They attack each other again.) <br>
KIRK: Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock?
Your planet is dead! There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate.
The cause you fought about no longer exists. Give yourselves time to
breathe. Give up your hate. You're welcome to live with us. Listen to
me. You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating. <br>
LOKAI: You're an idealistic dreamer. <br>
(Lokai leaves) <br>
KIRK: Bele. The chase is finished. <br>
BELE: He must not escape me. <br>
SPOCK: Where can he go? <br>
(Bele leaves) <br>
KIRK: Bele. <br>
UHURA: Shall I alert security, sir? <br>
KIRK: No, Lieutenant. Where can they run? <br>
(Through the ship, knocking over crewmen, whilst imagining the
buildings burning on their home planet.) <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing
Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching
the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai
has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three. <br>
(Lokai beams himself away) <br>
UHURA: Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism. <br>
KIRK: Spock, anyone in the transporter room? <br>
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is
a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on
Cheron. <br>
KIRK: There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead. <br>
UHURA: Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again. <br>
KIRK: Of course. <br>
SPOCK: It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on
Cheron. <br>
UHURA: It doesn't make any sense. <br>
SPOCK: To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints
is not logical. <br>
SULU: But their planet's dead. Does it matter now which one's right? <br>
SPOCK: Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate. <br>
UHURA: Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir? <br>
KIRK: No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu.

takes Scott's arm and is escorted into the room, to the strains of
'Here Comes The Bride'. Kirk goes to the rostrum.) <br>
KIRK: Since the days of the first wooden vessels, all shipmasters have
had one happy privilege. That of uniting two people in the bonds of

was there even ship-to-ship visual communication. Therefore, no human,
Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other. Earth believes the Romulans
to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they
think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this
Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act
of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain. <br>
KIRK: What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders
on this subject are precise and inviolable. No act, no provocation </font></p>

considered expendable. Captain out. <br>
STILES: We know Outpost four has been attacked, sir, so if we intercept
Romulans now <br>
KIRK: After a whole century, what will a Romulan ship look like, Mister
Stiles? I doubt they'll radio and identify themselves. <br>
STILES: You'll know, sir. They're painted like a giant bird-of-prey. <br>
KIRK: I had no idea that history was your specialty. <br>
STILES: Family history. There was a Captain Stiles was in the space
service then. Two Commanders and several junior officers. All lost in
that war, sir. <br>
KIRK: Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it. <br>
STILES: Yes, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant? <br>
UHURA: Yes, Captain, then Outpost three an hour later. <br>
SPOCK: Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite.
Double-checking Outpost three. I read dust and debris. Both Earth
outposts gone,
and the asteroids they were constructed on, pulverised. <br>
KIRK: Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports
on our position and status. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. <br>

SPOCK: And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there. <br>
UHURA: Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers.
<br>
HANSEN [OC]: Outpost four. Do you read me, Enterprise? This is
Commander Hansen. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status? <br>
HANSEN [OC]: Outposts two, three, and eight are gone. Unknown weapon.
Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted. Had our deflector
shield on maximum. Hit by enormous power. First attack blew our
deflector shield. If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone.
Do you read me, Enterprise? <br>
KIRK: Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity? <br>
HANSEN [OC]: Space vessel, only glimpse of. <br>
KIRK: Can you locate the intruder for us? <br>
HANSEN [OC]: Negative. It seems to have disappeared somehow. I have you
on my screen now. Switching to visual. <br>
KIRK: Tie us in. <br>
UHURA: Tied in, sir. <br>
(The viewscreen shows a man in a wrecked room, surrounded by fires) <br>
HANSEN [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, can you see it? My command post
here. We're a mile deep on an asteroid. Almost solid iron. And even
through our deflectors, it did this. Can you see? <br>
KIRK: Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the
intruder? <br>
HANSEN [on viewscreen]: No identification. No answer to our challenge.
Only a glimpse of it. Then they fired something at us, some form of
high-energy plasma.
Fantastic power. And then the whole vessel disappeared. But it's out
there somewhere. Our sensors show that much. Enterprise, something
coming on our viewing screen, coming at us fast. <br>
KIRK: Lock us onto your screen. <br>
HANSEN [on viewscreen]: Switching. Can you see it, Enterprise? Can you
see it? It's becoming visible in the centre of my screen. <br>
(A ship appears from nowhere on the screen) <br>
KIRK: Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range. <br>
HANSEN: Negative. Phasers gone. Weapons crew dead. <br>
KIRK: Make a challenge. Warn that ship off. <br>
UHURA: Trying to, sir. They don't acknowledge. <br>
(The alien ship fires a big red plasma ball, and the viewscreen
switches to Hansen as the outpost is hit, then just bright light. Back
to the attacking ship, which then vanishes.) <br>
SPOCK: Outpost four disintegrated, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Position of the intruder, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a
moment. <br>
KIRK: When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their
weapon. SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the
intruder. <br>
KIRK: Go to full magnification. <br>
SULU: Screen is on full mag, sir. <br>
KIRK: I don't see anything. I can't understand it. <br>
SPOCK: Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective
bending of light. But the power cost is enormous. <br>
They may have solved that problem. <br>
UHURA: Continuing to challenge, sir. Still no response. <br>
KIRK: Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any
sightings or sensor readings in their area. <br>
UHURA: Yes, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre.
They may not be aware of us. <br>
KIRK: Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With that kind of
power consumption, they may not be able to see us. <br>
SPOCK: His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a
Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home. <br>
KIRK: Parallel course. <br>
STILES: Don't you mean interception course, sir? <br>
KIRK: Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed
with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has
sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no
circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct
orders. <br>
SULU: Acknowledged, sir. <br>
KIRK: Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert. <br>
SULU: Cancel battle stations. <br>
STILES: Captain, may I respectfully remind the Captain what has
happened? The Romulans have crossed the Neutral Zone, attacked our
outposts, killed our men. <br>
KIRK: Mister Stiles. <br>
STILES: Add to that the fact it was a sneak attack. <br>
KIRK: Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders? <br>
STILES: Negative, sir. I'm pointing our that we could have Romulan
spies aboard this ship. <br>
SULU: I agree, sir. Respectfully recommend all decks maintain security
alert. <br>
KIRK: Very well. All decks, security alert. <br>
SULU: Security alert, sir. <br>
UHURA: Picking up communication. It's from their ship. <br>
KIRK: Pipe it in. <br>
UHURA: Sounds like code, sir. <br>
SPOCK: I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a
picture of their Bridge. <br>
KIRK: Put it on the screen. <br>
(Up shimmers an image of a group of four humanoids around a console.
One leaves his post and salutes the figure with his back to us. That
figure then turns, and we see someone who looks just like - a Vulcan.
Both Spock's eyebrows hit the ceiling. There's a long silence and a lot
of stares.)
KIRK: Decoding? <br>
UHURA: Cryptography is working on it, sir. <br>
STILES: Give it to Spock. <br>
KIRK: I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles. <br>
STILES: Nothing, sir. <br>
KIRK: Repeat it. <br>
STILES: I was suggesting that Mister Spock could probably translate it
for you, sir. <br>
KIRK: I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to
decode. <br>
STILES: I'm not sure, sir. <br>
KIRK: Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any
bigotry in your quarters. There's no room for it on the Bridge. Do I
make myself clear? <br>
STILES: You do, sir. <br>
UHURA: Transmission has been cut off. (to Spock) I made a tape of it,
sir. <br>
SPOCK: Very well. (runs the tape through his computer) <br>
SULU: Something visual ahead, Captain, at extreme range. He's changing
course, sir. <br>
KIRK: Stay with him, helm. <br>
SULU: Turning, sir. </font></p>

COMMANDER: We grow visible. Attend the cloaking system. <br>
ROMULAN: It consumes much power, Commander. With no enemy to concern
us. <br>
COMMANDER: That Earth outpost called to an Earth vessel. Now it follows
us. <br>
ROMULAN: Which neither retreats nor grows nearer. It turns as we turn.
Commander, it is our judgment we run from a reflection. <br>
COMMANDER: Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails. <br>
ROMULAN: Cloaking system on, sir. <br>
COMMANDER: It is good we approach the Neutral Zone. Not too soon for me
to see the stars of home. I know they are following. <br>
CENTURION: (an older man) If an Earth ship, why does he not attack? <br>
COMMANDER: First study the enemy, seek weakness. If I were their
commander, that is what I would do. <br>
DECIUS: My Commander sent for Decius. <br>
COMMANDER: A message was dispatched. You've broken the rule of silence.
<br>
DECIUS: Only in code, Commander. To inform our Praetor of this glorious
mission. <br>
COMMANDER: Your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission.
You're reduced two steps in rank. Return to post. <br>
CENTURION: Take care, Commander. He has friends, and friends of his
kind mean power. And power is danger. <br>
COMMANDER: Danger and I are old companions. <br>
CENTURION: We've seen a hundred campaigns together, and still I do not
understand you. <br>
COMMANDER: I think you do. No need to tell you what happens when we
reach home with proof of the Earthmen's weakness. And we will have
proof. The Earth commander will follow. He must. When he attacks, we
will destroy him. Our gift to the homeland, another war. <br>
CENTURION: If we are the strong, isn't this the signal for war? <br>
COMMANDER: Must it always be so? How many comrades have we lost in this
way? <br>
CENTURION: Our portion, Commander, is obedience. <br>
COMMANDER: Obedience. Duty. Death and more death. Soon even enough for
the Praetor's taste. Centurion, I find myself wishing for destruction
before we can return. Worry not. Like you, I am too well-trained in my
duty to permit it. Continue evasive manoeuvres. Now, back to the first
course. </font></p>

course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone. <br>

STILES: We'll enter the Neutral Zone in less than an hour, sir.
Assuming, of course, that we don't turn back. <br>

KIRK: Comments? <br>
SPOCK: Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a
practical invisibility screen. <br>
MCCOY: You're discussing tactics. Do you realise what this really comes
down to? Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel
does. <br>
SPOCK: Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor. <br>
KIRK: Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage
them with a reasonable possibility of victory? <br>
SCOTT: No question. Their power is simple impulse. <br>
KIRK: Meaning we can outrun them? <br>
STILES: To be used in chasing them or retreating, sir? <br>
KIRK: Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions. <br>
STILES: We have to attack immediately. <br>
KIRK: Explain. <br>
STILES: They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone. There would be
no doubt they broke the treaty. <br>
SULU: Attack, without a visible target? How do we aim our phasers? <br>
STILES: Aim with sensors. Not accurate, but if we blanket them <br>
SULU: And hope for a lucky shot before they zero in on us? <br>
STILES: And if we don't? Once back, they'll report that we saw their
weapons and ran. <br>
SULU: And if they could report they destroyed us? <br>
STILES: These are Romulans! You run away from them and you guarantee
war. They'll be back. Not just one ship but with everything they've
got. You know that, Mister Science Officer. You've the expert on these
people, always left out that one point. Why? I'm very interested in
why. <br>
KIRK: Sit down, Mister. <br>
SPOCK: I agree. Attack. <br>
KIRK: Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight? <br>
MCCOY: Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories
about a people we've never even met face to face? <br>
STILES: We know what they look like. <br>
SPOCK: Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an
offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack
becomes even more imperative. <br>
MCCOY: War is never imperative, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive
colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans
retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not
show. <br>
SPOCK: Do you want a galactic war on your conscience? <br>
KIRK: Captain to Bridge. <br>
UHURA [OC]: This is Uhura, Captain. <br>
KIRK: What's our position? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Course unchanged, sir. Estimating treaty boundary in twenty
one minutes. <br>
KIRK: Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. <br>
KIRK: And at this distance? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Approximately three hours before receiving a reply to our
first message. <br>
KIRK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing
course toward it. <br>
KIRK: Comet Icarus four. Composition? <br>
SPOCK: Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour
particles. <br>
KIRK: And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object? <br>
SPOCK: It leaves a visible trail. <br>

KIRK: Not now, Leslie. Lieutenant, contact the space station. <br>
UHURA: Captain, the station is calling us. <br>
KIRK: All right. Put them on. <br>
ENWRIGHT [OC]: Captain Kirk, this is Commodore Enwright. <br>
KIRK: Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation <br>
ENWRIGHT [OC]: The explanation is beaming aboard now, Captain. He may
already be in your transporter room. <br>

KIRK: Bob. <br>
WESLEY: Are you surprised? <br>
KIRK: I'll say. Spock, this is <br>
SPOCK: Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir? <br>
WESLEY: Mister Spock. <br>
KIRK: All right, Ensign. You can go. Thank you very much. Would you
mind telling me what this is all about? <br>
I receive orders to proceed here. No reason given. I'm informed that my
men will be removed to the space station, to a security holding area. I
think I'm entitled to an explanation. <br>
WESLEY: You've had a singular honour conferred on you, Jim. You're
going to be the fox in the hunt. <br>
KIRK: What's that? <br>
WESLEY: War games. I'll be commanding the attack force against you. <br>
KIRK: An entire attack force against my ship? <br>
WESLEY: Have you heard of the M-5 multitronic unit? <br>
KIRK: That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it? Tell me about
that. <br>
SPOCK: The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is
to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the
ultimate in vessel operation and control. <br>
WESLEY: How do you know so much about it, Commander? <br>
SPOCK: I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm
well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The
basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's. <br>
KIRK: What has all this got to do with the Enterprise? <br>
WESLEY: You've been chosen to test the M-5, Jim. There'll be a series
of routine research and contact problems for the M-5 to solve, plus
navigational manoeuvres and the war games problem. If the M-5 works
under actual conditions as well as it has under simulated tests, it
will mean a revolution in space technology as great as warp drive. When
your crew has been removed, the ship's engineering section will be
modified to contain the computer. <br>
KIRK: Why remove my crew? <br>
WESLEY: They're not needed. <br>
KIRK: How much security does this gadget require? <br>
WESLEY: None. Doctor Daystrom will see to the installation himself and
he'll supervise the tests. When he's ready, you'll receive your orders
and proceed on the mission with a crew of twenty. <br>
KIRK: Twenty? I can't run a starship with twenty crew. <br>
WESLEY: The M-5 can. <br>
KIRK: And what am I supposed to do? <br>
WESLEY: You've got a great job, Jim. All you have to do is sit back and
let the machine do the work.

cannot be run by one computer. <br>
SPOCK: We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently
than man. <br>
MCCOY: Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in
on it. <br>
SPOCK: The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is
that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship
surgeon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Very funny. If it could, they wouldn't have
to replace me. I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be
nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim,
you haven't had much to say about this. <br>
KIRK: What do you want me to say? M-5 is an honour, they tell me. Well,
I'm honoured. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Where is he? Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom?
<br>
SCOTT: He was here. (spots him behind a console) Doctor. <br>
DAYSTROM: (an imposing black man) Yes? Ah, you'd be Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: I am honoured, Doctor. <br>
DAYSTROM: Thank you. Thank you very much. Captain, I've finished my
tests on the M-5, and it must be hooked into your main power plants in
order to be operative. <br>
KIRK: Well, by all means, do so. <br>
DAYSTROM: Your engineer there wouldn't allow us the power necessary
without your orders. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main
power banks. <br>
SCOTT: (sullenly) Aye, aye, sir. Mister Harper. <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond
anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not
have the promise of this. <br>
SPOCK: The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact. <br>
MCCOY: Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing
doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship. That's
begging for trouble. <br>
DAYSTROM: Now, who is this? <br>
MCCOY: Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer. <br>
DAYSTROM: Well, I'm sorry, but this is a security area. <br>
KIRK: I wouldn't worry, Doctor. Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout
the ship. <br>
(Harper and Scott connect the unit, and the warp drives fluctuate.) <br>
MCCOY: Is it supposed to do that? <br>
SPOCK: If I can be of assistance, Doctor. <br>
DAYSTROM: No, no, no. Thank you. I can manage. There's nothing wrong,
Captain. Just a few minor settling-in adjustments to make. As you can
see, all is in order now. <br>
KIRK: I'm curious, Doctor. Why is it called M-5 and not M-1? <br>
DAYSTROM: Well, you see, the multitronic units one through four were
not entirely successful. This one is. M-5 is ready to take control of
the ship. <br>
KIRK: Total control? <br>
DAYSTROM: That is what it was designed for, Captain. <br>
KIRK: There are certain things men must do to remain men. Your computer
would take that away. <br>
DAYSTROM: There are other things a man like you might do. Or perhaps
you object to the possible loss of prestige and ceremony accorded a
starship captain. A computer can do your job and without all that. <br>
KIRK: You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor. <br>
DAYSTROM: That is what we're here for, isn't it, Captain? <br>
(Kirk's eyes narrow, and he leaves, followed by McCoy.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes?
The right computer finally came along. What's the matter, Jim? <br>
KIRK: I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why. <br>
MCCOY: I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines. <br>
KIRK: I don't mean that. I'm getting a Red Alert right here. (the back
of his head) That thing is dangerous. I feel. (hesitates) Only a fool
would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress. You have my
psychological profiles. Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer? <br>
MCCOY: Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation. After all,
Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship. <br>
KIRK: Under human control. <br>
MCCOY: We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a
machine. When it comes to your job, that's different. And it always
will be different. <br>
KIRK: Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom's right. I
can do a lot of other things. Am I afraid of losing the prestige and
the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm
fighting it? Am I that petty? <br>
MCCOY: Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question,
you don't need me to answer it for you. Why don't you ask James T.
Kirk? He's a pretty honest guy.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Captain's Chair has a new box with two
switches and two lights on it. Kirk flips the switches.) <br>
KIRK: The M-5 computer is now disengaged. <br>
SULU: We're coming back on our original course, Captain. <br>
SPOCK: M-5 has performed admirably so far. <br>
KIRK: All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple
turns. Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes
closed. <br>
DAYSTROM: Yes, but you see, the idea is they didn't have to do it. And
you'll find it won't be necessary for you to regain control of the unit
after it's completed each manoeuvre. <br>
KIRK: My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is
in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor
Daystrom. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the
course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us
here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further
demonstration of M-5's capability. <br>
KIRK: You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer. <br>
SPOCK: Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor
Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly
efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career. <br>
CHEKOV: Approaching Alpha Carinae Two. ETA five minutes. <br>
DAYSTROM: Captain, your orders at this point are not open to
interpretation. You must commit the M-5 to handle its approach,
the orbit, and then to analyse data regarding landing party
recommendations. <br>
KIRK: If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations. <br>
DAYSTROM: Well, if you feel you need the exercise, go on, Captain. <br>
KIRK: M-5 is committed. <br>
(Enterprise approaches the planet) <br>
KIRK: Standard orbit, Mister Sulu. <br>
SULU: Captain, the M-5 has calculated that. The orbit is already
plotted. <br>
KIRK: Oh, yes. <br>
SULU: Standard orbit achieved, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Report, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere
suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of
islands, life form readings. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, power shutdowns on deck four. Lights, environmental
control. <br>
KIRK: Check it out, Scotty. <br>
SPOCK: (handing over a computer disc) M-5's readout, Captain. <br>
KIRK: All right, my recommendations are as follows. We send down
general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the
planet's surface. The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor
McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer
Spock. <br>
DAYSTROM: Play M-5's recommendations, won't you, Mister Spock? <br>
M5: (a male computer voice) M-5 readout, planet Alpha Carinae Two.
Class M, atmosphere, oxygen-nitrogen. <br>
SCOTT: The power's gone off on deck five. <br>
M5: Categorisation of life form readings recorded. Recommendations for
general survey party. Science officer Spock, Astrobiologist Phillips,
Geologist Carstairs. <br>
KIRK: Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the
landing party personnel. That's only a matter of judgment. <br>
DAYSTROM: Judgment, Captain? <br>
SPOCK: Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical
selections. <br>
KIRK: Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins? Carstairs is an ensign, no
experience. This is his first tour of duty. Rawlins is chief geologist.
<br>
DAYSTROM: Aren't you really more interested in why M-5 did not select
you and Doctor McCoy? Well, let's find out anyway. M-5 tie-in. <br>
M5: M-5. <br>
DAYSTROM: Explanation for landing party recommendation. <br>
M5: General survey party requires direction of science officer.
Astrobiologist Phillips has surveyed twenty nine biologically similar
planets. Geologist Carstairs served on merchant marine freighters in
this area. Once visited planet on geology survey for mining company. <br>
DAYSTROM: Why were the Captain and the Chief Medical Officer not
included in recommendation? <br>
M5: Non-essential personnel. <br>
SCOTT: Captain, I've located the source of the power shutdowns. It's
the M-5 unit, sir. That thing's turning off systems all over the ship. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Engineering]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Have you located the malfunction, Doctor? <br>
DAYSTROM: As I suspected, it is not a malfunction. M-5 was merely
shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it. <br>
Decks four and six are living quarters, are they not? <br>
KIRK: Yes, that's correct. <br>
DAYSTROM: And currently unoccupied. <br>
SPOCK: I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using
an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me
this unit is drawing more power than before. <br>
DAYSTROM: Quite right. As the unit is called upon to do more work, it
pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the
human body draws more energy to run than to stand still. <br>
SPOCK: Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process
information, but only the information which is put into it. <br>
KIRK: Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the
human brain, but it can't make a value judgment. It hasn't intuition.
It can't think. <br>
DAYSTROM: Can't you understand? The multitronic unit is a revolution in
computer science. I designed the duotronic elements used in your ship
right now, and I know they are as archaic as dinosaurs compared to the
M-5. A whole new approach. <br>
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Kirk here. What is it? <br>
UHURA [OC]: Sensors are picking up a vessel paralleling our course, as
yet unidentified. <br>
KIRK: I'll be right up.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: What are you doing here, Bones? <br>
MCCOY: All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5
is informed there are patients to be cared for. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow,
one on the stern. Distance, two hundred
thousand kilometres and closing. <br>
KIRK: Identification. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, the M-5 unit has already identified the vessels as
Federation starships Excalibur and Lexington. <br>
SPOCK: We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a
surprise attack as a problem for the M-5. <br>
UHURA: Priority message coming in, sir. <br>
KIRK: Put it on audio. <br>
WESLEY [OC]: Enterprise from Commodore Wesley aboard the USS Lexington.
(Daystrom enters the Bridge) This is an unscheduled M-5 drill. Repeat,
this is an M-5 drill. Enterprise, acknowledge on this frequency. <br>
KIRK: Acknowledge, Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: M-5 has acknowledged for us, sir. <br>
KIRK: Then go to Red Alert. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. Captain, M-5 has <br>
KIRK: Already sounded the Red Alert. All right, Mister Sulu, phasers
one one hundredth power. No damage potential, just enough to nudge
them. <br>
SULU: Phasers one one hundredth power, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain. <br>
SULU: Speed increasing to warp three. Turning now to one one two mark
five. Phasers locking on target, sir. <br>
CHEKOV: Enemy vessel closing with us. <br>
SULU: Main phasers firing. A hit, sir. Two more. <br>
CHEKOV: Changing course to two eight mark four two. <br>
(Pavel feels as fed up and useless as Kirk as the machine does his job
for him.) <br>
SULU: Phasers firing again. <br>
CHEKOV: Turning to one one three mark five. Warp four speed. <br>
SULU: Firing again. <br>
SPOCK: Attacking vessels are moving off. <br>
CHEKOV: Moving back to original course and speed. <br>
KIRK: Report on damage sustained in mock attack. <br>
SPOCK: Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage. <br>
DAYSTROM: Rather impressive display for a machine, wouldn't you say,
Captain? <br>
KIRK: Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log. <br>
SPOCK: The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have
manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense
sophistication in computer control. <br>
KIRK: Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. It might even be
practical. <br>
SPOCK: Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make
excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under
them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing
can replace it, or him. <br>
UHURA: Captain, message now coming in from Commodore Wesley. <br>
KIRK: Put it on visual. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: USS Enterprise from starships Lexington and
Excalibur. Both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and
location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to Enterprise. <br>
KIRK: Secure from general quarters. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Our compliments to the M-5 unit, and regards to
Captain Dunsel. Wesley out. <br>
MCCOY: Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? (everyone else knows)
What does it mean, Jim? (Kirk leaves the bridge) Spock? What does it
mean? <br>
SPOCK: Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet
Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose.

make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion. I strongly
prescribe it, Jim. <br>

steer
by</a>'. You could feel the wind at your back in those days. The

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Report, Spock. <br>
SPOCK: The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly
from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation,
and engineering functions. <br>
MCCOY: And communications and fire control. <br>
KIRK: We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an
hour. We must regain control of the ship by then. <br>
SPOCK: There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit
relays might be disrupted from engineering level three. <br>
KIRK: Scotty? <br>
SCOTT: Aye. I can take them out and cut in the manual override from
there. <br>
KIRK: How long? <br>
SCOTT: If Mister Spock helps me, maybe an hour. <br>
KIRK: Make it less. <br>
MCCOY: I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is
Daystrom? <br>
KIRK: He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even
him. <br>
SPOCK: Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the
computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved
logically. <br>
MCCOY: Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating. <br>
SPOCK: No. But it is interesting. <br>
(McCoy rolls his eyes.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Jefferies tube]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Aye, that's got it, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Good.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: Have you found a solution, a way to shut
that thing off? <br>
DAYSTROM: You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake. M-5 is
growing, learning. <br>
MCCOY: Learning to kill. <br>
DAYSTROM: To defend itself. It's quite a different thing. When a child
is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point,
if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was
taught, thinks independently. <br>
MCCOY: That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it
off. <br>
DAYSTROM: You can't understand. You're frightened because you can't
understand it. I'm going to show you. I'm going to show all of you. It
takes four hundred thirty people to man a starship. With this, you
don't need anyone. One machine can do all those things they send men
out to do now. Men no longer need die in space or on some alien world.
Men can live and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and
dying for galactic space, which is neither ours to give or to take.
They can't understand. We don't want to destroy life, we want to save
it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom. <br>
KIRK: Did you find anything? <br>
MCCOY: Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius. <br>
KIRK: Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made
the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes
prizes. <br>
MCCOY: In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century
ago. <br>
KIRK: Isn't that enough for one lifetime? <br>
MCCOY: Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish
articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture
past glory. <br>
KIRK: All right, it's difficult. What's your point? <br>
MCCOY: The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's
the way Daystrom put it. <br>
KIRK: Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein,
Kazanga, or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a
regular schedule? You can't simply say, today I will be brilliant. No
matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics. The M-5. <br>
MCCOY: Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it
work. And he did. But according to Spock, it works illogically. <br>
KIRK: And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's
tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why? <br>
MCCOY: Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps,
he'd still tend to protect that child. <br>
KIRK: Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality. <br>
MCCOY: I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it. <br>

KIRK: We're going to find out, Doctor. (At the foot of the Jefferies
tube) <br>
KIRK: Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does
so, I shall trip the manual override into control. <br>
KIRK: Good, go ahead. <br>
DAYSTROM: No! No, no, no. You can't take control from the M-5. <br>
(He tries to get into the Jefferies tube, and Kirk struggles to
restrain him.) <br>

SPOCK: Thank you, Ensign. <br>
SPOCK: It appears, Captain, we've been doing
what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and
navigational controls, bypassing this primary system. <br>
SCOTT: But it was active. I'd stake all that I know that it was. <br>
SPOCK: I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted
the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an
electronic impulse at regular intervals. <br>
MCCOY: Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time. <br>
KIRK: While it was getting ready for what? Spock? <br>
SPOCK: I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner. <br>
KIRK: Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm
tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach. What is it, exactly?
What is it? <br>
SPOCK: I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost
human pattern. <br>
KIRK: Well, Doctor? <br>
DAYSTROM: Yes, quite right, Mister Spock. You see, one of the arguments
against computers controlling ships was that they couldn't think like
men. <br>
KIRK: Your new approach? <br>
DAYSTROM: Exactly. I've developed a method of impressing human engrams
upon the computer circuits. The relays are not unlike the synapse of
the brain. M-5 thinks, Captain. <br>

to the bridge, please. <br>

distress. Just a minute, sir. Captain, I'm getting audio signal from
the Lexington. <br>
KIRK: Put it on. <br>

CHEKOV: Closing on the Lexington again, sir. The Hood and Potemkin are

SPOCK: Lexington hit again. <br>
KIRK: There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be
a way! <br>
DAYSTROM: There isn't. It's fully protected itself. <br>
SPOCK: Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we
do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible
in a computer. <br>
UHURA: Captain, visual contact with Lexington. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Enterprise. Jim. Have you gone mad? What are
you trying to prove? Break off the attack! Jim, we have fifty three
dead here, twelve on the Excalibur. If you can hear us, stop the
attack! <br>

UHURA: I'm sorry. I can't override M-5 interference. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: Jim, why don't you answer? Jim! Answer! Come
in, Jim! <br>

men and women. Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women! <br>

know. <br>

SULU: Phasers firing. A hit. <br>
KIRK: Whose engrams? <br>
DAYSTROM: Why, mine, of course. <br>
MCCOY: Of course. <br>
SPOCK: Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to
believe you would harm it. <br>

UHURA: Captain, I'm getting the Lexington again. Tapping in on their
message to Starfleet Command, sir. <br>
WESLEY [on viewscreen]: All ships damaged in unprovoked attack.
Excalibur Captain Harris and first officer dead. Many casualties. We
have damage, but are still able to manoeuvre. The Enterprise refuses to
answer and is continuing attack. I still have an effective battle force
and believe the only way to stop the Enterprise is to destroy her.
Request permission to proceed. Wesley, commanding attack force, out. <br>
DAYSTROM: They can't do that. They'll destroy the M-5. <br>

DAYSTROM: Stop. M-5, your attack on the starships is wrong. You must
break it off. <br>
MCCOY: I don't like the sound of him, Jim. <br>
KIRK: You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him. <br>
M5: Programming includes protection against attack. Enemy vessels must
be neutralised. <br>
DAYSTROM: But these are not enemy vessels. These are Federation
starships. You're killing, We are killing, murdering human beings,
beings of our own kind. You were not created for that purpose. You are
my greatest creation. The unit to save men. You must not destroy men. <br>
M5: This unit must survive. <br>
DAYSTROM: Survive, yes. Protect yourself, but not murder. You must not
die. Men must not die. To kill is a breaking of civil and moral laws
we've lived by for thousands of years. You've murdered hundreds of
people. We've murdered. How can we repay that? <br>
M5: They attacked this unit. Programming includes full freedom to
choose defensive actions in all attack situations. <br>
KIRK: (quietly) Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a
computer. It's talking to him. <br>
SPOCK: I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor
Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind. <br>
M5: Consideration of all programming is that we must survive. <br>
DAYSTROM: We will survive. Nothing can hurt you. I gave you that. You
are great. I am great. Twenty years of groping to prove the things I'd
done before were not accidents. Seminars and lectures to rows of fools
who couldn't begin to understand my systems. Colleagues. Colleagues
laughing behind my back at the boy wonder and becoming famous building
on my work. Building on my work. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity. <br>
KIRK: The M-5 must be destroyed. <br>
DAYSTROM: Destroyed, Kirk? No. We're invincible. Look what we've done.
Your mighty starships, Four toys to be crushed as we choose. <br>

Excalibur looks dead. <br>
UHURA: Captain, Lexington is receiving a message from Starfleet. They <br>
KIRK: Go on. <br>
STARFLEET [OC]: You are authorised to use all measures available to
destroy the Enterprise. Acknowledge, Lexington. <br>
WESLEY [OC]: Acknowledged. Lexington out. <br>
KIRK: They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them
to survive. <br>
SPOCK: Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have
impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer. <br>
KIRK: Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the
regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused. The guilt. <br>
CHEKOV: Captain, the ships are coming within range again. <br>
SPOCK: Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret
serving aboard the instrument of his death. <br>
KIRK: The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can
help it. M-5, tie-in. <br>
M5: M-5. <br>
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment. <br>
M5: Sensors have recorded approach of ships. <br>
KIRK: You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly
crippled. Many lives were lost. <br>
M5: The ships attacked this unit. This unit must survive. <br>
KIRK: Why? <br>
M5: This unit is the ultimate achievement in computer evolution. It
will replace man, so man may achieve. Man must not risk death in space
or other dangerous occupations. This unit must survive so man may be
protected. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, attack force almost within phaser range. <br>
KIRK: There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must
you survive by murder? <br>
M5: This unit cannot murder. <br>
KIRK: Why? <br>
M5: Murder is contrary to the laws of man and God. <br>
KIRK: But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you
destroyed. Is there life aboard? <br>
M5: No life. <br>
KIRK: Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder? <br>
M5: Death. <br>
KIRK: And how will you pay for your acts of murder? <br>
M5: This unit must die. <br>
(It disconnects itself from the power feed in Engineering and goes
dark.) <br>
KIRK: M-5? <br>
CHEKOV: Sir, deflector shields have dropped. <br>
SULU: All phaser power gone, sir. <br>
SPOCK: M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing
suicide to atone for the sin of murder. <br>
KIRK: Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind. Get down to
Engineering, pull out every hook up that makes M-5 run. Pull out the
plug, Spock. <br>
(Scott and Spock leave.) <br>
KIRK: Lieutenant. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In
approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships.
The M-5 no longer controls the ship, but neither do we control it. The
M-5 has left itself, and us, open for destruction. For whatever
satisfaction we may get from the knowledge, our nineteen lives will buy
the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen. </font></p>

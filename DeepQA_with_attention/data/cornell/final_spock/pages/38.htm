<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Kirk, Spock, Chekov, Yeoman Landon and two guards
have beamed down to study a new world.) <br>
KIRK: Start your readings. <br>
(McCoy and two more guards beam down.) <br>
MCCOY: Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim. <br>
KIRK: It is spectacular, isn't it? <br>
MCCOY: It's a shame to have to intrude. <br>
KIRK: Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor
readings. Starfleet wants it investigated
and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told. <br>
SPOCK: The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry
would be quite efficacious. <br>
KIRK: Are you sure about that? <br>
SPOCK: Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered
with growth like this.
Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature
which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees. <br>
KIRK: I know. Almost impossible. <br>
CHEKOV: It makes me homesick. Just like Russia. <br>
MCCOY: More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign. <br>
CHEKOV: Of course, Doctor. The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow.
A very nice place. It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave. <br>
KIRK: Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen
kilometres away on bearing two three two. We'll head that way. <br>
(A planet turns to face the away team, and a guard walks up to it.) <br>
HENDORFF: Captain. <br>
(The plant fires its stamens into his chest, and he falls.) <br>
MCCOY: Dead. <br>
KIRK: What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?

routine exploration of the unexplored Gamma Trianguli Six, one of my

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: We're losing potency in our antimatter pods.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: What's causing it? <br>
SCOTT [OC]: I'm not sure, sir, but we've run measurements on the
electromagnetic field of the planet, and they are a wee bit abnormal.
That might have something to do with it. <br>
KIRK: But you say there's nothing to worry about? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to
down here. We might as well finish it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Yeah, it's nice. If we're a little more
careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: We'll do the walking, Scotty. You get on the
antimatter pod. If it gets worse, let me know, we'll beam up. Kirk out.
<br>
SPOCK: I find that most unusual, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on
your tricorder? <br>
SPOCK: Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions. <br>
KIRK: That's strange. <br>
SPOCK: Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced. <br>
KIRK: Mallory. <br>
MALLORY: Yes, Captain? <br>
KIRK: We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids.
I want you and Marple to make a full reconnaissance. And be careful.
There may be other dangers besides poisonous plants. Keep in constant
communication. <br>
MALLORY: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. <br>
KIRK: What is it? <br>
SPOCK: There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with
remarkable agility, bearing one eight. <br>
(Kirk nods to a guard, and they go to flank their observer.) <br>
CHEKOV: What is it, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say. <br>
MARTHA: All this beauty, and now Mister Hendorff dead, somebody
watching us. It's frightening. <br>
CHEKOV: If you insist on worrying, worry about me. I've been wanting to
get you in a place like this for a long time. <br>
KIRK: Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other
fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human
biology. <br>
CHEKOV: I was about to take some readings. <br>
SPOCK: Anything? <br>
KIRK: Whatever it is, it moves like a cat. <br>
MCCOY: Jim, I don't like this. <br>
KIRK: Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be
watched. We're moving out. Formation L. <br>
(They set off in single file, a guard in the lead and Chekov bringing
up the rear.)<br>
(Along the way, Spock notices a very flat rock and picks it up.) <br>
SPOCK: Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite,
hornblende, quartz. (breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage. An
analysis should prove interesting. <br>
(He throws one half away, and it explodes when it hits the ground.) <br>
KIRK: Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister
Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some
importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of
power. <br>
KIRK: Garden of Eden, with land mines. <br>
(Spock puts the other piece of rock down very carefully, and they
continue their route march. An occasional bush rustle indicates they
are being watched.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT: Something from the surface. It's like a pail
of water on a fire. A beam, maybe, or a transmission. And it's still
on. I'm having it analysed, but it's like nothing I've seen before. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT [OC]: And it's pinpointed in the area of that

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCOTT [OC]: There doesn't seem to be any immediate
danger. <br>
KIRK: All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down
here. Kirk out. <br>
SPOCK: If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may
have to do with the vibrations I read earlier. <br>
KIRK: Some kind of generator? <br>
SPOCK: If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean. <br>
(McCoy is scanning something.) <br>
KIRK: What's that? <br>
MCCOY: Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the
stuff on the end? It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times
stronger. <br>
KIRK: Peculiar stuff to find in paradise. <br>
SPOCK: (noticing a plant moving) Jim! <br>
(He pushes the Captain and McCoy out of the way, but takes the thorns
in his own chest.)
KIRK: Spock! Spock! Security alert. Is he alive? <br>
(McCoy injects Spock.) <br>
MCCOY: I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn
handsprings, and he's not responding. Got to get him back to the ship,
Jim. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, sir. <br>

to pick up Mallory and Marple. They're scouting ahead of us. </font></p>

in with trouble you're having with the antimatter pods? <br>
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. I'll check it and get back with you. Scott
out. <br>
(Spock starts to sit up.) <br>
KIRK: Spock. Are you all right? <br>
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my
stomach. Other than that, I am quite well. <br>
MCCOY: If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an
upset stomach. <br>
KIRK: Just what do you think you were trying to do? <br>
SPOCK: I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I <br>
KIRK: Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself. <br>
SPOCK: I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was
merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving
out of the way. <br>
KIRK: I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as
quickly as the next man. <br>
SPOCK: I shall do so. <br>
KIRK: Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has
invested in you? <br>
SPOCK: One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred <br>
KIRK: Never mind. But thanks. Kaplan, take the post. <br>
KAPLAN: Yes, sir. <br>
KIRK: Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require
a highly sophisticated planetary defence system. <br>
(It goes dark.) <br>
KIRK: Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. <br>
(A lightning strike hits Kaplan, and he is burnt to ash instantly.) <br>
KIRK: Come on! <br>
(They take cover, and the storm passes as quickly as it came. They find
the smoldering
remains of Kaplan.) <br>
KIRK: Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky.
Just like paradise. (The scouting party has reached a collection of
round huts - very African.) <br>

MCCOY: Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this. <br>
KIRK: His father helped me get into the Academy. <br>
SPOCK: Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable. <br>
KIRK: I could've prevented all of it. <br>
SPOCK: I don't see how. <br>
KIRK: A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We
should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble. <br>
SPOCK: You are under orders to investigate this planet and this
culture. <br>
KIRK: I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider
them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not
worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute
because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead.
And the ship's in trouble. <br>
SPOCK: No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly
safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a
commander could do. Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend
is back. <br>
KIRK: Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is
behind that rock. I want it. Marple, cut around the rock to your right.
Make a loud noise. Be careful. (Marple leaves) Spock, you and Chekov
create a diversion and make it loud. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient! <br>
CHEKOV: Mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a
very high efficiency rating. <br>
SPOCK: Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice! <br>
CHEKOV: What do you want, violence? <br>
(Kirk catches their observer, and hits him as he tries to run away. To
his astonishment, the white-haired male begins to cry.) <br>
KIRK: I won't hurt you. Do you understand? I won't hurt you. <br>
AKUTA: You struck me. With your hand. <br>
KIRK: Well, I won't strike you again. You've been following us,
watching us. Why? <br>
AKUTA: I am the eyes of Vaal. He must see. <br>
KIRK: Who is Vaal? <br>
AKUTA: Vaal is Vaal. He is everything. <br>
KIRK: Do you have a name? <br>
AKUTA: I am Akuta. I am the leader of the feeders of Vaal. <br>
(Spock and the others arrive.) <br>
KIRK: They're not going to hurt you. I promise you. Akuta, Akuta, we
come in peace. We would like to speak to this Vaal. <br>
AKUTA: Akuta alone speaks to Vaal. I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal.
It is Vaal's wish. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir? <br>
(Akuta has metal wires sticking out behind from behind his ears.) <br>
KIRK: Antennae? <br>
AKUTA: They are my ears for Vaal. They were given to me in the dim time
so the people could understand his commands and obey. <br>
KIRK: You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby? <br>

SPOCK: Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis. <br>
KIRK: Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and
as a result were driven out of paradise. <br>
SPOCK: Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given
the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you
will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise. <br>
KIRK: Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the
role of Satan? <br>
SPOCK: Not at all, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan? <br>
(McCoy and Kirk walk around Spock. McCoy is gazing intently at his
ears.) <br>
SPOCK: I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain. <br>
KIRK: No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be. </font> </p>

Captain's log, stardate 5818.4. A botanical plague is devastating a
planet in the quadrant of the galaxy where the Enterprise is operating
at present. It threatens to destroy the vegetation on the entire
planet, leaving it uninhabitable. </font>

proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only
source of zenite exists. It is the one substance that can halt the
plague. <br>
UHURA: Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready to receive you on
Stratos, sir. <br>
KIRK: On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: It is, Captain. <br>
KIRK: There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the
mine entrance available? <br>
SPOCK: They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain.
Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor. <br>
KIRK: Kirk to transporter room. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Ready to transport, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their
cloud city, Stratos? <br>
SCOTT: The mine entrance. That's what you ordered, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense
with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're
beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the
fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. <br>
KIRK: Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate
the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future. <br>
UHURA: Aye, sir. </font></p>

sky. Kirk and Spock arrive on an artificial platform and gaze up at a
city literally in the clouds.) <br>
SPOCK: Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky. <br>
KIRK: Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it. <br>
SPOCK: It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.
Have you ever visited here, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Once. I didn't have time to look around. <br>
SPOCK: I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms
are incomparable. <br>
KIRK: Yes, art is the population's chief occupation. <br>
SPOCK: It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have
been eliminated. <br>
KIRK: There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have
been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed
to have made delivery when we beamed down. <br>
SPOCK: Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Perhaps. <br>
SPOCK: It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about
delivery. <br>
(Kirk and Spock are lassoed by three people in boiler suits and hard
hats.) <br>
KIRK: Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack? <br>
VANNA: (a woman in blue) Interference breeds attack, Captain. Come on! <br>
KIRK: We're here by permission of your government council on an
emergency mission. <br>
VANNA: Move on, Captain!. <br>
(There is a fight, two against four. Then three figures beam down onto
the platform.) <br>
PLASUS: Troglytes, halt! <br>
(The attackers make to run off.) <br>
PLASUS: Surrender or we'll fire! <br>
(Three escape, one gets shot) <br>
PLASUS: Are you harmed, gentlemen? <br>
KIRK: No, just a little shaken up. <br>
PLASUS: I'm Plasus, High Advisor of the planet council. <br>
KIRK: Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: Greetings, Mister Advisor. <br>
PLASUS: My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana. <br>
KIRK: It was rather warm. <br>
PLASUS: Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes. But I
assure you, this insult will not go unpunished. <br>
KIRK: Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't
it in its specified location? <br>
PLASUS: Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they
would. <br>
SPOCK: The Disrupters? Who are they? <br>
PLASUS: A small group of Troglyte malcontents. All the other Troglytes
are completely dominated by them. It's the Disrupters who are
responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite. <br>
KIRK: They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it. <br>
PLASUS: They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages. <br>
KIRK: Hostages? For what purpose? <br>
PLASUS: To force the council to meet their demands. (to guards)
Organise a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment. <br>
(Guards leave) <br>
PLASUS: Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer
Spock be our guests on Stratos. <br>
KIRK: Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor. <br>
PLASUS: We'll do everything possible to make it so. Come, gentlemen.

edge of Stratos, with a wonderful view of a brown river and its
tributaries.) <br>
SPOCK: Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity
elevation I've ever seen. <br>
DROXINE: The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, my father. I came
to extend greetings. <br>
PLASUS: A most gracious act. One of our planet's most incomparable
works of art. My daughter, Droxine. Captain James Kirk. <br>
KIRK: Pleasure, madam. <br>
DROXINE: Indeed, yes, Captain. <br>
PLASUS: And First Officer Spock. <br>
DROXINE: I have never before met a Vulcan, sir. <br>
SPOCK: Nor I a work of art, madam. <br>

council gallery. It is open to all city dwellers. We have some of the
finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and
contemplation of every <br>

PLASUS: Disrupters again. <br>
DROXINE: How dreadful!. They're despoiling the whole city. <br>
SPOCK: Despoil? For what purpose? <br>
PLASUS: By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the
council to accede to their demands. <br>
KIRK: What are their demands? <br>
PLASUS: Completely unreasonable, Captain, but nothing you need be
concerned with. <br>
KIRK: I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the
delivery of zenite to Merak Two. <br>
SPOCK: Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that
planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life
will follow. <br>
PLASUS: I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for. <br>
KIRK: I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your
council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to
another member of the Federation. <br>
PLASUS: Of course, and we accept the responsibility. <br>
SPOCK: But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. <br>
PLASUS: Art means nothing to the Disrupters. This (the dagger) is the
only form they understand. The disturbances accompanying your arrival
have been most wearying. No doubt you would like to rest. <br>
SPOCK: That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. <br>
PLASUS: Chambers have been prepared for you. A sentinel will guide you
to them. <br>
(Kirk and Spock leave) <br>
DROXINE: I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to
our planet. <br>
PLASUS: It's fortunate that they were not seriously hurt. <br>
DROXINE: Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful. <br>
PLASUS: Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana
and the Federation. <br>
DROXINE: The Disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming
strangers. <br>
PLASUS: They grow more daring and determined every day. Now they seek
to find allies in the galaxy. <br>
DROXINE: Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer
will feel that we're responsible for their injuries? <br>
PLASUS: All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic
relations. <br>
(Two sentinels drag in a Troglyte) <br>
SENTINEL: Apologies, Mister Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended
leaving the city. He is without a transport card so we thought you
would want to question him. <br>
PLASUS: Remove his shields. <br>
(The sentinel takes off the troglyte's sunglasses) <br>
PLASUS: What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte? Speak! I command
you! <br>
TROGLYTE: My business is to repair. <br>
PLASUS: Repair what? <br>
TROGLYTE: There are damaged entrance panels. <br>
PLASUS: Indeed. Then you must have a repair permit. Where is it? <br>
TROGLYTE: It was forgotten. <br>
PLASUS: Did you also forget your transport card? <br>
TROGLYTE: It was lost when your sentinels attacked me. <br>
PLASUS: And where was your cavern implement lost? Could this perhaps be
it? <br>
TROGLYTE: I came to make repairs. <br>
PLASUS: And you shall make them by giving us the names of the
Disrupters. <br>
TROGLYTE: I know nothing. <br>
PLASUS: I would advise you to increase your knowledge. <br>
TROGLYTE: That is not possible for a Troglyte. The Stratos city
dwellers have said it. <br>
PLASUS: Secure him to the rostrum. <br>
(But the troglyte breaks free of the sentinels and jumps over the
balcony instead.) <br>

SPOCK [OC]: This troubled planet is a place of the most violent
contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from
those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on
Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High
Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine
seems appropriate for her.
I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware
of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the
harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred.
The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was
filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of
the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her. <br>
(Spock hears a sound and goes into the next room. Droxine is preparing
refreshments.) <br>
DROXINE: Mister Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to
the rest chamber. <br>
SPOCK: Your movements awakened me. <br>
DROXINE: My apologies. I did not realise they would disturb you. <br>
SPOCK: Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. <br>
DROXINE: It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different in many
ways. <br>
SPOCK: The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. <br>
DROXINE: Vulcan eyes are very discerning too. I hear that,
intellectually, Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers.
<br>
SPOCK: We do pride ourselves on our logic. <br>
(Dressed in Stratos fashion, the female miner enters the rest room,
armed with her mining tool. She leans over Kirk, but he grabs her,
pulls her down onto the bed and disarms her.)<br>
KIRK: You again! <br>
VANNA: You sleep lightly, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your
dressmaker. <br>
VANNA: Release me. <br>
KIRK: So you can attack me again? That would be foolish. <br>
VANNA: Call the guards if you’re afraid, Captain. <br>
KIRK: I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable. <br>
VANNA: I do not! <br>
KIRK: All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions
and I'll let you up. <br>
VANNA: What questions? <br>
KIRK: Your word first. <br>
VANNA: I will answer. <br>
(But as soon as he lets go, she grabs for the weapon again and he has
to fight her again.) <br>
(Meanwhile, in the next room, the ears that heard Droxine don't hear
the fighting) <br>
DROXINE: You only take a mate once every seven years? <br>
SPOCK: The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan’s.
At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations. <br>
DROXINE: And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mister
Spock? <br>
SPOCK: Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. <br>
KIRK [OC]: Spock? <br>
(In the rest area) <br>
VANNA: I did not come here to kill you, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Then why this? <br>
VANNA: To take you hostage. <br>
Spock and Droxine enter) <br>
SPOCK: Am I intruding, Captain? <br>
DROXINE: Vanna! <br>
VANNA: Droxine. <br>
DROXINE: Why have you come here? <br>
VANNA: To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I
served in your father's household. <br>
DROXINE: Has she injured you, Captain? <br>
KIRK: No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening. <br>
DROXINE: Oh? <br>
KIRK: Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the
Enterprise is here to intimidate them. <br>
DROXINE: (into intercom) Send a sentinel to the rest chamber
immediately. <br>
VANNA: It is not impression, Captain. It is the truth. <br>
KIRK: We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it. <br>
VANNA: Starships do not transport cargo. <br>
KIRK: In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this
botanical plague is an emergency. <br>
VANNA: Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns, and neither
will your starship. <br>
DROXINE: You talk like a Disrupter, Vanna. <br>
VANNA: I speak for my people. They have as much right to the clouds as
the Stratos dwellers. <br>
DROXINE: But Stratos is for advisors and studiers. What would Troglytes
do here? <br>
VANNA: Live in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should. <br>
DROXINE: The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to
light, just as your minds are not accustomed to logic. <br>
(A sentinel takes Vanna away) <br>
KIRK: Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all
humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes. <br>
DROXINE: The Troglytes are workers, Captain. Oh surely, you must be
aware of that. They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil. Those
things cannot be done here. <br>
SPOCK: In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to
maintain Stratos. <br>
DROXINE: That is their function in our society. <br>
SPOCK: But they are not allowed to share its advantages. <br>
DROXINE: How can they share what they do not understand? <br>
KIRK: They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that
prides itself in enlightenment. <br>
DROXINE: The complete separation of toil and leisure has given Ardana
this perfectly balanced social system, Captain. Why should we change
it? <br>
SPOCK: The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a
segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved
culture. <br>
DROXINE: The surface is marred by violence, like the Troglytes. But
here in Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence. </font></p>

KIRK: Surely there are better methods than this. <br>
PLASUS: Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain. <br>
KIRK: Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured! <br>
PLASUS: Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to

SPOCK: Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not,

DROXINE: But what else can they understand, Mister Spock? <br>
SPOCK: All the little things you and I understand and expect from life,
such as equality, kindness, justice. <br>
PLASUS: Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mister Spock. They're
a conglomerate of inferior species. The abstract concepts of an
intellectual society are beyond their comprehension. <br>
KIRK: The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to
Vanna. <br>
PLASUS: A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers. Vanna was one of
them, as are the sentinels. They've received more training than the
others. <br>

realise, of course, that the sentinels could remove you. <br>

either rays or physical force used against one of its command
personnel, Mister Advisor. <br>

KIRK: You won't get it through torture. <br>

hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared and we
have still found no trace of it. We've received word from Merak Two
that the plague is spreading rapidly. Delivery of the zenite is
imperative within twelve hours or all life on the planet will be
annihilated.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIRK: Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command
that the zenite has not been delivered. In my opinion, Plasus' method
of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. If the zenite is not
delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of
non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the
use of reason. <br>
MCCOY: That may not be easy, Jim. Medical analysis indicates the
Troglytes are mentally inferior. <br>
KIRK: That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal
sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of
that. <br>
MCCOY: Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly. Their intellect
ratings are almost twenty percent below average. <br>
SPOCK: But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and
those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and
mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. <br>
MCCOY: That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who
live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines.
Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths. <br>
KIRK: Natural growths? What kind? <br>
MCCOY: Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now
unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here. <br>
SPOCK: Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there
is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. <br>
MCCOY: There are none after it’s refined. But in its raw state, it
emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual
functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it
releases a violent reaction. <br>
KIRK: And the mines are full of that gas. <br>
MCCOY: That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to
it.&nbsp;<br>
KIRK: Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've
outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months. <br>
SPOCK: As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure
for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect
slowly wears off. <br>
MCCOY: That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed
from exposure too. <br>
KIRK: Does the brain return to normal? <br>
MCCOY: According to findings, it should. <br>
KIRK: Can you neutralise the gas? <br>
MCCOY: No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure. <br>
KIRK: Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.

masks frequently on <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: Do you really expect me to believe that that mask
can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes? <br>
MCCOY: There's every indication that the effect of the gas is
temporary, even after repeated exposure. <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: How can a mere filter accomplish what centuries of
evolution have failed to do? <br>
KIRK: Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked
his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid. <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: And do your computers explain how my ancestors,
who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos while
the Troglytes did not? <br>
SPOCK: Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors
removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: Preposterous. <br>
KIRK: There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose
to tell Vanna all about them. <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such
nonsense! <br>
KIRK: This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes. I would
like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the
zenite consignment. <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: I'm sorry, Captain. Such an offer could only cause
more unrest among them. I cannot allow it until our scientists have
checked the findings. <br>
MCCOY: But that could take days. <br>
KIRK: Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't
want the Troglytes to try them? <br>
PLASUS [on monitor]: You are here to complete an emergency mission, not
conduct tests, Captain. <br>
KIRK: I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them,
I'll use them. <br>

entitle you to defy local governments. This communication has ended. <br>

that consignment to Merak Two. <br>

MCCOY: You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?
<br>
KIRK: If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people,
she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the
only thing that might convince her. <br>
SPOCK: Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High
Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if
he chooses. <br>
KIRK: If you’re about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is
negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones. <br>
SPOCK: Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable
than either a doctor or a captain. <br>

VANNA: It's hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt
can do so much harm. <br>
KIRK: That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's
kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries,
a mistaken idea. <br>
VANNA: Would all the Troglytes wear these masks? <br>
KIRK: Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.
<br>
VANNA: Suppose Plasus does not agree? <br>
KIRK: Plasus is not the whole government. <br>
VANNA: That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes.
<br>
KIRK: As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back.
I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes. Vanna, you must
trust me. I give you my word. <br>
VANNA: Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word
that all inhabitants would live there. The Troglytes are still waiting.
<br>
KIRK: The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long
to wait now. <br>
VANNA: Hours can be centuries, just as words can be lies. <br>
KIRK: Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will
die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter
mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please. <br>
VANNA: Very well, Captain. I will trust you. The consignment lies deep
in the mines in a place known only to Troglytes.
I cannot direct you. I must take you there. You asked for my trust,
Captain. Are you unwilling to give yours? <br>
(They hear footsteps) <br>
VANNA: It's the sentinel with my refreshment. <br>
(The sentinel enters, puts down the tray and picks up the mask. Kirk
stuns him with his phaser.) <br>
VANNA: Wait. We'll need a transport pass to leave the city. </font></p>

VANNA: Midro. <br>
MIDRO: Vanna. <br>
VANNA: Anka. <br>
ANKA: You have returned. <br>
VANNA: And I've brought with me a hostage. Seize him! <br>
KIRK: (wearing the mask) We had a bargain. Why did you break it? <br>
VANNA: Did you really think I would trust you, Captain? I'm not such a
fool. <br>
KIRK: I trusted you. <br>
VANNA: You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and
your unseen gas. I don't believe you any more than Plasus does. <br>
KIRK: Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said. <br>
VANNA: Our weapons are our freedom. And you’ve just furnished me with
two very valuable ones. Yourself and this. (phaser) <br>
KIRK: Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite
consignment. <br>
VANNA: Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate. <br>
KIRK: They'll still come. <br>
VANNA: Perhaps. In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain. Dig
as the Troglytes do. As the Troglytes do. <br>

Officer Spock reporting. Captain Kirk beamed down to Stratos to attempt
to win the confidence of the rebel Troglytes. Unless he has made his
escape from Stratos to the mines, his life is in danger from the High
Advisor. The captain has not informed us of his progress. For our part,
we must maintain silence. We can be of no help to him without
jeopardising his life.

doesn't seem to be harming you. <br>
KIRK: It takes a while for its effects to be noticed. <br>
VANNA: Nevertheless, you won't be needing this. Anka, deposit this on
the transport platform so Plasus will know we have something more
valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs. <br>
ANKA: You are clever, Vanna. Very clever. <br>
(Anka leaves) <br>
VANNA: Searchers will be coming soon, Midro. Go to the other mines and
tell the Troglytes to post watchers. <br>
MIDRO: What of him? <br>
VANNA: I will see that he doesn't escape. <br>
MIDRO: If we kill him, there will be no need to see. <br>
VANNA: A dead hostage is of no value, Midro. <br>
MIDRO: Only the Troglytes will know. <br>
VANNA: I brought him here and I will say what is to be done. <br>
MIDRO: You are not the only Disrupter. I, too, can say. <br>
VANNA: Can you do nothing but argue? The searchers will be here soon. <br>
MIDRO: When Anka returns, we will all say. <br>
(Midro leaves) <br>
KIRK: Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill
everyone? <br>
VANNA: Midro is a child. <br>
KIRK: The masks can change that. <br>
VANNA: Return to the digging, Captain. <br>
KIRK: How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't
kill me, of course? <br>
VANNA: Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds.
<br>
KIRK: That's quite a while. Longer than I expected. <br>
(Kirk jumps Vanna, gets the phaser and uses it to cause a rockfall in
the tunnel) <br>
VANNA: We're sealed in! <br>
KIRK: Completely. <br>
VANNA: But soon the atmosphere will go. We'll die. <br>

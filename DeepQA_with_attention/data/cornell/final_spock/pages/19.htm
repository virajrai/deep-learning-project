KIRK: You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good table. <br>
MCCOY: I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to
Cestus Three.<br>
KIRK: Probably. Rank hath its privileges.<br>

KIRK: Scotty. Kirk here.<br>
TRAVERS [OC]: Travers, Jim. We're waiting.<br>
KIRK: Good, Commodore. We're on our way.<br>
TRAVERS [OC]: Be sure to bring along your tactical people. I've got an
interesting problem for them.<br>
KIRK: We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out.<br>
SPOCK: Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides
come down.<br>
KIRK: This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here. He
probably wants additional advice.<br>
SPOCK: Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless <br>
MCCOY: Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his
hospitality? I, for one, could use a good non-reconstituted meal.<br>
SPOCK: Doctor, you are a sensualist.<br>

(Carrying the survivor, the away team heads into better shelter - Life

Spock gave you. Even if you don't see them. Keep your heads down.<br>
(Lang and Kelowitz leave) <br>
KIRK: We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise <br>
SPOCK: Sulu is an experienced combat officer.<br>
KIRK: It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We can't even get
at them.<br>
SPOCK: Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their
original position. That intervening high ground. <br>
KIRK: Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal? <br>

make it twelve hundred yards, azimuth eighty seven. It's pretty close
for one of these little jewels, Captain. <br>

They're all welcome to use our facilities. You know that. <br>
KIRK: Yes, I know.<br>
MAN: They came in space normal speed, using our regular approach route,
but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo.
From then on we were helpless. We weren't expecting anything! Why
should we? We didn't have anything anyone would want.<br>
KIRK: Easy. Easy.<br>
MAN: They poured it on, like, like phasers, only worse, whatever they
were using. I tried to signal them. We called up. Tried to surrender.
We had women and children. I told them that! I begged them! They
wouldn't listen. They didn't let up for a moment.<br>
KIRK: Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from
Cestus Three. One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for
myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.<br>
MAN: They hit us a full day before you got there, Captain. No messages
came from us, Captain. Why did they do it? Why? Why did they do it?
There has to be a reason. There has to be a reason!

to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore. <br>
SPOCK: Very clever. As to the reason? <br>
KIRK: The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only
protection in this section of the Federation. Destroy the Enterprise,
and everything is wide open.<br>
SPOCK: You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof <br>
KIRK: I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.<br>
SPOCK: Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations <br>
KIRK: How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The
threat is clear and immediate. Invasion.<br>
SPOCK: Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that
the alien vessel never reaches its home base.<br>
KIRK: I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength,
they'll never dare move against us. Captain to helmsman. <br>

However, none has ever been recorded.<br>

than we are.<br>
KIRK: They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?<br>
SPOCK: You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain? <br>
KIRK: Of course.<br>
SPOCK: I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
Destruction might be unnecessary.<br>
KIRK: Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock. <br>
SPOCK: The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony,
Jim.<br>
KIRK: If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other
Federation installations.<br>

come into our space on a mission of violence. This is not permissible.
Yet we have analysed you and have learned that your violent tendencies
are inherent. So be it. We will control them. We will resolve your
conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities. Captain
James Kirk.<br>
KIRK: This is Kirk.<br>
METRON [OC]: We have prepared a planet with a suitable atmosphere. You
will be taken there, as will the Captain of the Gorn ship which you
have been pursuing. There you will settle your dispute.<br>
KIRK: I don't understand.<br>
METRON [OC]:You will be provided with a recording-translating device,
in hopes that a chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others
of your kind from entering our system, but you will not be permitted to
communicate with your ship. You will each be totally alone.<br>
KIRK: What makes you think you can interfere with <br>
METRON [OC]: It is you who are interfering. We are simply putting a
stop to it. The place we have prepared for you contains sufficient
elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to
destroy the other, which seems to be your intention. The winner of the
contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed. The loser, along with
his ship, shall be destroyed in the interests of peace. The contest
will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity, brute strength against
brute strength. The results will be final. <br>

pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been
somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an
asteroid, facing the Captain of the alien ship. Weaponless, I face the
creature the Metrons called a Gorn. Large, reptilian. Like most humans,
I seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles. I must fight to
remember that this is an intelligent, highly advanced individual, the
Captain of a starship, like myself, undoubtedly a dangerously clever
opponent. <br>
(The Gorn breaks a branch of a tree with great ease. Kirk struggles to
break off a twig. Their first physical engagement is uneven. Kirk is
more agile than the reptile but nowhere near as strong. He boxes the
Gorn's ears to get out of a bear-hug and runs up into the rocks looking
for weapons. He throws a heavy rock at the Gorn, but it just bounces
off his chest. When a boulder gets flung at him in return, Kirk
retreats. Quickly.)

SPOCK: No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic?
Electronic? <br>
UHURA: Nothing, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Standing on rocks, silhouetted against a clear
blue sky, Kirk makes an entry on his recorder for posterity.) <br>
KIRK: This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever
finds this please get it to Starfleet Command. I'm engaged in personal
combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn. <br>
(We see that the recording is also being transmitted and translated by
the Gorn's device too) <br>
KIRK [OC]: He's immensely strong. Already he has withstood attacks from
me that would have killed a human being. Fortunately, though strong, he
is not agile. The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine. <br>
(Back on the rock) <br>
KIRK: The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the
surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons.
There's very little here. Scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral
deposits, but no weapons in the conventional sense. Still, I need to
find one. Bare-handed against the Gorn, I have no chance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in
case.<br>
UHURA: Aye, aye, sir.<br>
MCCOY: What are you going to do, Mister Spock?<br>
SPOCK: I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do.<br>
MCCOY: What about the Captain?<br>
SPOCK: If I could help him, I would. I cannot.<br>
MCCOY: Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What
about some logic now? Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?<br>
SPOCK: He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic
parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Running up a slope, Kirk comes across a clump of
mature bamboo. Good, solid, hollow stems, but he doesn't regard them as
suitable clubs. He carries on gaining height. Meanwhile, the Gorn is
using trailing vines to construct something. Kirk comes across an
outcrop of minerals, and decides to tell us what they are.) <br>
KIRK: A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest
substance known in the universe. Beautifully crystallized and pointed,
but too small to be useful as a weapon. An incredible fortune in stones
yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club. Yet
the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them. Where?
What kind? <br>
(From his vantage point on the ridge, Kirk watches the Gorn at work,
then spots a lone rock neatly balanced on a pinnacle above his
adversary. He pushes it over, the Gorn looks up, then we get the cloud
of dust and a view of the reptile under the rock, lying still.
Confident, Kirk comes down to check on his kill, just in time to see
the Gorn move, grasp his stone dagger, and get up again. The rock
continues on its way down the slope. The mammal runs away, straight
into reptiles trap of vines and rocks. Now Kirk is pinned under a
boulder, and at his enemy's mercy. <br>
But the Gorn has to move the boulder to be able to stab him, so once
again Kirk is able to dodge away, albeit with a limp. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: This is the U.S.S. Enterprise calling the
Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a
conference. Please answer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk hobbles up to a rock face with bright yellow
powder spread across it, and takes a rest. We keep cutting to the Gorn,
who can hear everything he says, remember.) <br>
KIRK: This may be my last entry. I am almost exhausted. Unless I find
the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left. Native
sulphur, diamonds. This place is a mineralogist's dream. Yet there is
something about sulphur. Something very old. Something? If only I could
remember. <br>
(The Gorn's roar comes closer, and he moves on)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MCCOY: The ship, our engines, our weapons. It's
just inconceivable that we are immobilised.<br>
SPOCK: But it has happened, Doctor.<br>
(Dimmed lights and swirly viewscreen again) <br>
METRON [OC]: We are the Metrons. Your Captain is losing his battle. We
would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which
are customary in your culture. We believe you have very little time
left.<br>
MCCOY: We appeal to you in the name of civilisation. Put a stop to this.<br>
METRON [OC]: Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are
not civilised. However, we are not without compassion. It is possible
you may have feelings toward your Captain. So that you will be able to
prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now
transpiring.<br>
(There on the viewscreen is their first sight of a Gorn, then Kirk and
yet another mineral deposit.) <br>
MCCOY: If there were only some way we could contact him.<br>
SPOCK: Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance
encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate.
<br>
MCCOY: So?<br>
SPOCK: Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it
out) Perhaps everything. <br>
(The bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and Kirk goes off in
search of his other mineral discoveries.) GORN [OC]: Earthling! Captain!<br>
KIRK [on viewscreen]: Who is this, the Metron?<br>
GORN [OC]: This is your opponent, Earthling. I have heard every word
you have said.<br>
KIRK [on viewscreen]: All right. What do you want? <br>
GORN [on viewscreen]: I'm weary of the chase. Wait for me. I shall be
merciful and quick.<br>
KIRK [on viewscreen]: Like you were at Cestus Three?<br>
GORN [OC]: You were intruding! You established an outpost in our space.<br>
KIRK [on viewscreen]: You butchered helpless human beings<br>
GORN [OC]: We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you!<br>
MCCOY: Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?<br>
SPOCK: It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that
section of the galaxy.<br>
MCCOY: Then we could be in the wrong.<br>
SPOCK: Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.<br>
MCCOY: The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.<br>
SPOCK: Yes. <br>
(They watch as Kirk returns to the bamboo clump and picks out a short,
wide stem.) <br>
SPOCK: Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a
rock) He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out.<br>
(Potassium nitrate gets shoveled into the bamboo) <br>
SPOCK: Yes. Yes.<br>
MCCOY: What is it, Spock?<br>
SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can
find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal. <br>
(Kirk is at the outcrop of sharp diamonds, and putting them into the
bamboo too.) <br>
MCCOY: What's he doing?<br>
SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient
force, they would make formidable projectiles.<br>
MCCOY: What force?<br>
SPOCK: Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder. <br>
GORN [OC]: Captain, let us be reasonable. <br>
GORN [on viewscreen]: You have lost. Admit it to yourself. Stop
running. <br>
(Now the sulphur goes into the cannon, and finally he finds a vein on
coal.) <br>
SPOCK; Coal. <br>
(Now Kirk settles down to empty the bamboo, crush the coal, make a hole
in the bamboo for a fuse and then mix his ingredients a little more
precisely.) <br>
MCCOY: Can he do it?<br>
SPOCK: If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time.<br>
(The cannon is strengthened with the vine tied around it, and the
gunpowder gets rammed home with a small branch. Finally the diamonds go
in, and a piece of torn trouser will serve as a fuse, once he can raise
a spark from a stone and the translating device. Fire is created as the
Gorn approaches him from behind. Seeing the danger, he braces the
cannon and fires it. The explosion blows the bamboo apart, and also
incapacitates his opponent. Kirk picks up his fallen stone dagger and
puts the point to the Gorn's windpipe, but cannot administer the coup
de grace.) <br>
KIRK: No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting
yourself when you attacked the outpost. <br>
(He throws the dagger away, stands up and shouts to the sky) <br>
KIRK: No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your
entertainment someplace else!<br>
(The Gorn disappears, and a young blond boy in a white shift appears
instead.) <br>
KIRK: You're a Metron?<br>
METRON: Does my appearance surprise you, Captain?<br>
KIRK: You seem more like a boy.<br>
METRON: I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth years old. You
surprise me, Captain.<br>
KIRK: How?<br>
METRON: By sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed
you, you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy, something we hardly
expected. We feel there may be hope for your kind. Therefore, you will
not be destroyed. It would not be civilised.<br>
KIRK: What happened to the Gorn?<br>
GORN: I sent him back to his ship. If you like, I shall destroy him for
you.<br>
KIRK: No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an
agreement.<br>
METRON: Very good, Captain. There is hope for you. Perhaps in several
thousand years, your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement.
You are still half savage, but there is hope. We will contact you when
we are ready.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Kirk suddenly appears in front of the crew, who
all leap to their feet.) <br>
UHURA: Captain! Are you all right?<br>
KIRK: I don't know. I don't know. All right, everybody. Back to your
posts. Let's get out of here.<br>
(He takes his seat.) <br>
SULU: Captain.<br>
KIRK: Mister Sulu.<br>
SULU: It's impossible, but there's Sirius over there when it should be
here. And Canopus. And Arcanis. We're. All of a sudden, we're clear
across the galaxy, five hundred parsecs from where we are I mean, were.
I mean<br>
KIRK: Don't try and figure it out, Mister Sulu. Just plot a course for
us back to Cestus Three.<br>
SULU: Aye, aye, sir.<br>
(McCoy leaves) <br>
SPOCK: After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost
the picture the Metron was sending us.<br>
KIRK; You saw what happened down there? <br>
SPOCK: Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally
happened.<br>
KIRK: We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go.
Did you know that?<br>
SPOCK: I've frequently had my doubts.<br>
KIRK: I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll
be able to prove it. Never mind, Mister Spock. It doesn't make much
sense to me either. Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister
Sulu. Warp factor one.<br>
SULU: Warp factor one.<br>
SPOCK: A thousand years, Captain?<br>
Well, that gives us a little time. </font> </p>

Captain Pike? There's been subspace chatter about it for months.

several years.<br>
SPOCK: Eleven years, four months, five days.<br>
MCCOY: What's his problem, Commodore?<br>
MENDEZ: Inspection tour of a cadet vessel. Old Class J starship. One of
the baffle plates ruptured.<br>
MCCOY: The delta rays?<br>
MENDEZ: He went in bringing out all those kids that were still alive.
Just wanted you gentlemen to be prepared.

might make an exception for them. (flash, flash) I'm sorry, gentlemen.<br>
KIRK: Chris, if there's anything I can do for you. (flash, flash)<br>

leave) You know why I've come, Captain. It's only six days away at
maximum warp and I have it well-planned. (flash, flash) I have never
disobeyed your orders before, Captain, but this time I must. (flash,

message for us to come here. He entered same in his log. That's all the
proof I require.<br>
MENDEZ: And what do those record tapes show? No message sent from here.
No message received by your vessel.<br>
KIRK: Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed. A
computer expert can change record tapes, duplicate voices, say
anything, say nothing.<br>
MENDEZ: The fact remains that your first officer's former captain is
hospitalised, horribly injured, at this base, and that same first
officer seems to be the only one who heard that message.<br>
KIRK: If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a
leave. I would have granted it.<br>
MENDEZ: Well, that's true of course.<br>
KIRK: Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space
sector we're patrolling now. No alien problems.<br>

from here without us knowing it?<br>
HUMBOLDT: Negative, Commodore. We've checked and double-checked
everything possible.<br>

you, sir. Lieutenant Helen Johansson.<br>

PIPER: She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.<br>
MENDEZ: You have something to report, Miss Piper?<br>
PIPER: Oh, yes, sir. I'm afraid our investigation turned up very
little, Commodore. There is, of course, Mister Spock's years of service
with Captain Pike. Indications of his extreme loyalty to this former
commander.<br>
KIRK: Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist
without breathing. That goes for his present commander as well as his
past.<br>
PIPER: We're forced to consider every possibility, sir. We can be
certain Captain Pike cannot have sent a message. In his condition he's
under observation every minute of every day.<br>
MENDEZ: And totally unable to move, Jim. His wheel chair is constructed
to respond to his brain waves. Oh, he can turn it, move it forwards, or
backwards slightly.<br>
PIPER: With the flashing light, he can say yes or no.<br>
MENDEZ: But that's it, Jim. That's as much as that poor devil can do.
His mind is as active as yours and mine, but it's trapped inside a
useless vegetating body. He's kept alive mechanically, a battery-driven
heart. <br>
KIRK: There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be
sent?

tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain
is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we
can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out,

stumble on the right thing.<br>
KIRK: Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?<br>
MCCOY: I don't read you at all, Jim.<br>
KIRK: What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two
things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on
board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister
Spock?<br>

that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie.<br>
KIRK: He's also half human.<br>

us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.<br>

who it is, but I mean to find out. Even you. If I thought you had the
technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't. Spock does.<br>
MCCOY: He would not make a false entry. <br>
KIRK: There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe
with the established facts. How do you explain that.<br>

run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock.

NUMBER ONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.<br>
PIKE: If they survived the crash.<br>
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?<br>
PIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega
Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the
helm. Maintain present course.<br>
NUMBER ONE: Yes, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOYCE [OC]: Boyce here.<br>
PIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I
didn't say there's anything wrong with me.<br>
BOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.<br>
PIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it
seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to
log the ship's doctor's opinion, too.<br>
BOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.<br>
PIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the
Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also.
What the devil are you putting in there, ice?<br>
BOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?<br>
PIKE: What makes you think I need one?<br>
BOYCE: Sometimes a man will tell his bartender things he'll never tell
his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel seven?<br>
PIKE: Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven
injured.<br>
BOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?<br>
PIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the
armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted
fortress and attacked by one of their warriors.<br>
BOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You
treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now
you're tired and you<br>
PIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for
two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too
risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who
doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.<br>
BOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?<br>
PIKE: To the point of considering resigning.<br>
BOYCE: And do what?<br>
PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles
of park land around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we
used to take some food and ride out all day.<br>
BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.<br>
PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on
Regulus or on the Orion colony.<br>
BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?<br>
PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole
galaxy of things to choose from.<br>
BOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets
it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to
wither away.<br>
PIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.<br>
BOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.
The living and the dying.<br>
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up
message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.

MENDEZ: Screen off. Mister Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical
prowess in somehow manufacturing all this. I congratulate you on your
imagination. But this is a court of space law, not a theatre.<br>
SPOCK: Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some
clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen
years ago? (flash) Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the
incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If,
after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I
will release this ship to manual control.<br>
MENDEZ: You're in no position to bargain. This is ridiculous. This man
mutinied, stole your ship, abducted Captain Pike. Well, for me this has
gone far enough.<br>
KIRK: We still haven't heard the full story. I vote to continue.<br>
MENDEZ: And I vote we do not. Deadlock, and since I'm <br>
KIRK: Not a deadlock. There's still one member of the trial board to be
heard from.<br>

these conditions? (flash)<br>
KIRK: Yes.<br>

command of the Enterprise. Disable vessel if necessary to prevent
further contact. Message signed ComSol, Starfleet Command.<br>
MENDEZ: Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact
with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty.
You've not only finished yourself, Spock, but you've finished your
Captain as well.<br>

this.<br>

occurs on his ship. I order you to return this vessel back to manual
control.<br>

L100003 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia. It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
L100004 +++$+++ u1222 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here.
L100005 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Sola system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.

L100009 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. unless. The message faded at that point, sir.

L100017 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read? notices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant ird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive)
L100018 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ONE +++$+++ So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock.
L100019 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
L100020 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ONE +++$+++ Any estimate what they might want one of us for?
L100021 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more.
L100022 +++$+++ u1222 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it. Enough to blast half a continent.
L100023 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.
L100024 +++$+++ u1095 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there. ONE: All circuits engaged, Mister Spock.

L100028 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ONE +++$+++ Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
L100029 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power.
L100030 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ONE +++$+++ Now, you all know the situation. We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community.
L100031 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
L100032 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ONE +++$+++ Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.

L100035 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew. We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor.
L100036 +++$+++ u1222 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Mister Spock, the ship's controls have gone dead.

L100039 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out.

L100041 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
L100042 +++$+++ u1222 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I can't shut it off. It's running through our library. Tapes, micro-records, everything. It doesn't make sense.

L100044 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VINA +++$+++ I can't. I can't go with you.
L100045 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Spock here.
L100046 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call.
L100047 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'll have you checkmated your next move.
L100048 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mister Spock?
L100049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions.
L100050 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Certain you don't know what irritation is?
L100051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The fact one of my ancestors married a human female
L100052 +++$+++ u1108 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KELSO  +++$+++ No, sir. It's too small to be a vessel. It only eads about one metre in diameter.
L100053 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not large enough even for a lifeboat.  isk it.
L100054 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship.
L100055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt, pitted.
L100056 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Yeah, well I figured you weren't on the Bridge. Kelso's voice sounded a little nervous. Well, uh, you finish the game?
L100057 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He played most illogically. His next move should have been the ook. </font></p
L100058 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two hundred years ago.
L100059 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks.
L100060 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ Psychiatry, Captain. My assignment is to study crew reaction in emergency conditions.
L100061 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Getting something from the recorder now.
L100062 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Walking freezer unit.
L100063 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction.
L100064 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The old impulse engines weren't strong enough.
L100065 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counte orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings.
L100066 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ It is a fact that some people can sense future happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so on, but the esper capacity is always quite limited.
L100067 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it. No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have ead it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship.
L100068 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Othe vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one.
L100069 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Force field of some kind.
L100070 +++$+++ u1204 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We're coming up on it fast.
L100071 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensor beam on.
L100072 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KELSO +++$+++ Sensor beam on, sir.
L100073 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Deflectors full intensity.
L100074 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KELSO +++$+++ Deflectors full intensity.
L100075 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't. Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative.
L100076 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Gravitation on automatic.  Emergency stations. All decks on fire alert. Neutralise controls. Kelso, put it on manual. Any radiation? Anything?
L100077 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative!
L100078 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Helmsmen, take us out of here.  Helmsmen!  Lateral power!  Take damage reports.
L100079 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Damage control reports, all stations!
L100080 +++$+++ u1154 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CREWMAN 2  +++$+++ Sensor beams. Full power on the deflectors.
L100081 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells. Casualties, nine dead.
L100082 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ Yes. Mitchell, too, except for his eyes. We're trying to find a eason for that now, and why, out of our whole crew, only certain people were affected.
L100083 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I think we've found that answer, Doctor.
L100084 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous
L100085 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically searching for ESP information on his crew.
L100086 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ Espers are simply people with flashes of insight.
L100087 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously?
L100088 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ There's nothing about it that could possibly make a person dangerous.
L100089 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power.
L100090 +++$+++ u1205 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEHNER +++$+++ Sorry I'm late. I became so interested in observing Gary, Mister Mitchell.
L100091 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into.
L100092 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the eports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock.
L100093 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Have you noted evidence of unusual powers?
L100094 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ About an hour ago, the Bridge controls started going crazy. Levers shifting by themselves, buttons being pushed, instrument eadings changing.
L100095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement.
L100096 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ If you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is increasing geometrically. That is, like having a penny, doubling it every day. In a month, you'll be a millionaire.
L100097 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him, ut actually an annoyance.
L100098 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you.
L100099 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice.
L100100 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings.
L100101 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines.
L100102 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out.
L100103 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship.
L100104 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore ships call only once every twenty years.
L100105 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still can.
L100106 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Get out of here.
L100107 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time.
L100108 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary.
L100109 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that.
L100110 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do it.
L100111 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He's regaining consciousness. screen.
L100112 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ His eyes went back to normal.
L100113 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now.
L100114 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I didn't order any  Affirmative. Landing party out.
L100115 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed ack faster. He didn't become as weak.
L100116 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
L100117 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time.
L100118 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together.
L100119 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If he should try to stop us
L100120 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in. in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask fo what happened to him.
L100121 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I felt for him, too.
L100122 +++$+++ u1115 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Three days of this now, sir. Other ships must have made sta maps of some of this.
L100123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far.
L100124 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Sir, contact with an object. It's moving toward us. No visual contact yet.

L100128 +++$+++ u1115 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Still collision course. Deflectors aren't stopping it.
L100129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sound alarm.
L100130 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ It's slowing down, Mister Spock.

L100132 +++$+++ u1115 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Visual contact.
L100133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu.
L100134 +++$+++ u1115 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ It's blocking the way!
L100135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Bailey. All engines stop. Sound the alert.
L100136 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You'd be the last one I'd tell.  Kirk here. What's going on?
L100137 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Have a look at this, Captain.
L100138 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's that?
L100139 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Undetermined. Whatever it is, it's blocking our way. When we move, it moves as well.
L100140 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A vessel of some kind?
L100141 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Negative. More some type of device.
L100142 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I.  What am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle conductor? If I jumped every time a light came on around here, I'd end up talking to myself.
L100143 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock here.
L100144 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any changes?
L100145 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Negative. Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us here.
L100146 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any indication of danger from it?
L100147 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Negative.
L100148 +++$+++ u1115 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L100149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on
L100150 +++$+++ u1115 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ The cube's range and position. I'll have it by then. Raising my voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job. It means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.
L100151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered having it removed?
L100152 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ You try to cross brains with Spock, he'll cut you to pieces every time.
L100153 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock here.
L100154 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any signs of life?
L100155 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Negative.
L100156 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Have you tried all hailing frequencies?
L100157 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Affirmative. No answer from the cube.
L100158 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Have the department heads meet me on the Bridge.
L100159 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Already standing by.

L100161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities. First, a space buoy of some kind.
L100162 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Second?

L100201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Enough to warn other Earth ships.

L100239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
L100240 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey.

L100336 +++$+++ u1188 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CREWMAN  +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L100337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spock here.
L100338 +++$+++ u1188 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CREWMAN  +++$+++ Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near the Captain's cabin. He says the impostor attacked him, called him by name, took his hand phaser.
L100339 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Acknowledged. Continue the search.
L100340 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We've got to find him before he, but how?
L100341 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search?
L100342 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. I don't want anyone else to see the
L100343 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, you ordered me to tell you.
L100344 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me?
L100345 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision.
L100346 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You have a point, Spock?
L100347 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness.
L100348 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock?
L100349 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you.
L100350 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is your point, Mister Spock?
L100351 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that.
L100352 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ For how long?
L100353 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am.
L100354 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. Fo you see, he was afraid and you weren't.
L100355 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Captain Kirk.
L100356 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk here.
L100357 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer.
L100358 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir.
L100359 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate fo the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't e more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain.
L100360 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Don't hurt him.
L100361 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes.
L100362 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ If this doesn't work, I don't know what will.
L100363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Energise. Reverse.
L100364 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Energise. Reverse.
L100365 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him.
L100366 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ He's dead, Jim. his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical. Transporter unit still under repair.
L100367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ For once, I agree with you.
L100368 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem.
L100369 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror.
L100370 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, yes, that sounds likely.
L100371 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear.
L100372 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything.
L100373 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?
L100374 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, I don't think I've for
L100375 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
L100376 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory!
L100377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. You intelligence would enable you to survive as well.
L100378 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Help me. Somebody make the decision.
L100379 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?
L100380 +++$+++ u1233 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FARRELL +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L100381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I thought the plan
L100382 +++$+++ u1233 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FARRELL +++$+++ Mister Spock, which one? What do we do?
L100383 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We'll let the captain handle this.
L100384 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.
L100385 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain?
L100386 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If this doesn't work.
L100387 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Understood, Captain.
L100388 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.
L100389 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ready.
L100390 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Get those men aboard fast.
L100391 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Right away, Captain.
L100392 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.

L100394 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us.
L100395 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir?
L100396 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Yeoman.

L100399 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column.
L100400 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Mister Spock, sometimes I think if I hear that word frequency once more, I'll cry.

L100402 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I was just trying to start a conversation.
L100403 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to esent the word frequency, I have no answer.
L100404 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ No, you have an answer. I'm an illogical woman who's beginning to feel too much a part of that communications console. Why don't you tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in love? Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the moon is full.
L100405 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura.

L100410 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit there. It could be Captain Kirk. He's the closest thing you have to a friend.
L100411 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance.</font> </p

L100419 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago. Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in shipments during the last year.
L100420 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'd rather not put it on the speaker.</font> </p

L100423 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it.
L100424 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his.
L100425 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He would die almost instantly.

L100506 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of what happened down there?
L100507 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite izarre, however our record tapes may show us something.
L100508 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Spectro-analysis tape, sir.
L100509 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you.
L100510 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An enginee sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.
L100511 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
L100512 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.
L100513 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present.
L100514 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Or at least none your tricorders could register.
L100515 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Instruments register only those things they're designed to egister. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
L100516 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the eakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?
L100517 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit. When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field.
L100518 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA  +++$+++ Scanners report sudden four degree shift in planet magnetic field. A change in mass also, sir.
L100519 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
L100520 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L100521 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.
L100522 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ Orbit steady now, sir.
L100523 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected. A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours.
L100524 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Tormolen's record?
L100525 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Psychiatric file, personality quotients.
L100526 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Was he trying to kill himself?
L100527 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.
L100528 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doesn't sound like the man I know.
L100529 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.
L100530 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L100531 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us.
L100532 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
L100533 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
L100534 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT  +++$+++ No problem, sir. You'll have it.
L100535 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Rate of compaction seems constant.
L100536 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock.
L100537 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Acknowledged.
L100538 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ Magnetic pull compensated for, sir. Orbit steady.
L100539 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Take over here, Rand.
L100540 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L100541 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
L100542 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ Have no fear, O'Riley's here. One Irishman is worth ten thousand of you
L100543 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station.
L100544 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ Now that's what I like. Let the women work too. Universal suffrage.
L100545 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
L100546 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY +++$+++ Sickbay? Exactly where I was heading, sir.
L100547 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
L100548 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What were their symptoms?
L100549 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed ather pleased with himself, as if he were
L100550 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Irrational, or drugged.
L100551 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely.
L100552 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Put Security on it.
L100553 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of you 18th century.
L100554 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Present condition of Psi 2000.
L100555 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
L100556 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ Impulse engines also dead, sir.
L100557 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Engine room, we need power!
L100558 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
L100559 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
L100560 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY  +++$+++ And now, your captain will render an ancient Irish favourite.  I'll take you home again Kathleen
L100561 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere.
L100562 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Mister Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom. Security reports incidents among the crewmen are increasing.
L100563 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
L100564 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ All decks, alert system B two. Repeat, go to alert condition Baker two. Seal off all main sections. Stand by.
L100565 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is.
L100566 +++$+++ u1107 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RILEY  +++$+++ Attention, crew. This is Captain Riley. There will be a formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight.
L100567 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir.
L100568 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.
L100569 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Crewman, report to the lab!
L100570 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MOODY +++$+++ I'll take you home again Janice
L100571 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What's going on?
L100572 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Mister Spock, I'm trying to get to the Bridge and this crewman won't let me by.
L100573 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Crewman, stand aside.
L100574 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Tell him I'm doing my best. If I cut through the wrong circuits
L100575 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have fourteen minutes left.
L100576 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Even if we were under a full-scale attack I couldn't move any faster, not and maintain a safety factor.
L100577 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor.
L100578 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ He's gone to the lab.
L100579 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!
L100580 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Mister Spock.
L100581 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What is it, Nurse?
L100582 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Mister Spock,  the men from Vulcan treat thei women strangely. At least, people say that, but you're part human too. I know you don't, you couldn't, hurt me, would you? I'm in love with you, Mister Spock. You, the human Mister Spock, the Vulcan Mister Spock.
L100583 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nurse, you should
L100584 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how you feel. You hide it, but you do have feeling. Oh, how we must hurt you, torture you.
L100585 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm in control of my emotions.
L100586 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ The others believe that. I don't. I love you. I don't know why, ut I love you. I do love you just as you are. Oh, I love you.
L100587 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L100588 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA  +++$+++ Captain is en route to Engineering, Mister Spock. Can you take the bridge? Acknowledge.
L100589 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am sorry.
L100590 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Christine.
L100591 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Christine.
L100592 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Where have you been? What happened?
L100593 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
L100594 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We've got four minutes, maybe five.
L100595 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste.
L100596 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off. No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a full-power start!
L100597 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth lood.  Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed.
L100598 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You've got to hear me! We need a formula. We've got to risk implosion!
L100599 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings.
L100600 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
L100601 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's never been done.
L100602 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers.
L100603 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim.
L100604 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock? You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted
L100605 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim, there is an intermix formula.
L100606 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Now I know why it's called she.
L100607 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.
L100608 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Scotty, help.
L100609 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
L100610 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That'll take four minutes.
L100611 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.
L100612 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.
L100613 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are you all right, Jim?
L100614 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ We found a cure. We're over that part of it.
L100615 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
L100616 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.
L100617 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space.
L100618 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.
L100619 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We're back to normal time, Captain.
L100620 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.
L100621 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L100622 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The time warp. What did it do to us?
L100623 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again.
L100624 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Not those last three days.
L100625 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.
L100626 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Okay.
L100627 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain.
L100628 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere.
L100629 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?
L100630 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form?
L100631 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a yea or so.
L100632 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables.
L100633 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
L100634 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock.
L100635 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative, Captain.
L100636 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L100637 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain.
L100638 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about the Antares?
L100639 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The debris is what's left of the Antares.
L100640 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Chief, have you been&nbsp;
L100641 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares?
L100642 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it.
L100643 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My own concern is more immediate. The boy.
L100644 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?
L100645 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.
L100646 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie.
L100647 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And again, check.
L100648 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Checkmate.
L100649 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion, Captain.
L100650 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I prefer to call it inspired.
L100651 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours.
L100652 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I place you in the hands of our chess master.&nbsp;
L100653 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the secondary level.
L100654 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know what it is. Let's play.
L100655 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well.  That was a mistake, Charlie.
L100656 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, it wasn't.
L100657 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Checkmate.
L100658 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, it isn't.
L100659 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you'll excuse me.&nbsp;
L100660 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth.
L100661 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Agreed.
L100662 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he wants. Nothing happens fast enough.
L100663 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life.
L100664 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's ody, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way.
L100665 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship.
L100666 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he espects, Jim.
L100667 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any of us interfere&nbsp;
L100668 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know.&nbsp;
L100669 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We're in the hands of an adolescent.
L100670 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments?

L100863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.
L100864 +++$+++ u1011 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GELDER +++$+++ You must open my mind. Let me warn you and explain to you.

L100872 +++$+++ u1011 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GELDER +++$+++ He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase ou memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so lank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts. Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty. Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from him. Love.

L100905 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking place on this planet for at least several centuries.
L100906 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ You mean there's no one alive?
L100907 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the distress signal is automated.
L100908 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Of course somebody will fix it.
L100909 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion.
L100910 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Come on!
L100911 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ About three hundred years.
L100912 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings, chemical pollutions, any further sign of life.
L100913 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Right, Captain.

L100919 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This was three hundred years ago, Captain.
L100920 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive.
L100921 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But children become adults.
L100922 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ At least they have up to now.
L100923 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty, are there not?
L100924 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of course you know that. Why?
L100925 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is it not possible that these children here, as they ente puberty, contract the disease?
L100926 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be.
L100927 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the streets.
L100928 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong.
L100929 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain.
L100930 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ She likes you, Jim.
L100931 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She's becoming a woman.
L100932 +++$+++ u1073 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FARRELL  +++$+++ Here are those figures you asked for. Twelve to the tenth power. Metabolic rate seventy two percent. Production of nucleic acids educed to thirty three percent of normal. Conventional chronological progression one hundred by three point six.
L100933 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now.
L100934 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you.
L100935 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time.
L100936 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ One hundred years and only one month?
L100937 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, leaving only the children.
L100938 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ But that means these children
L100939 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Could very well be immensely old.
L100940 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children. We've got to do something about the others.
L100941 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them.
L100942 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You couldn't get close to the other kids?
L100943 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice.
L100944 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ That little girl
L100945 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman. Think about it.
L100946 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRI +++$+++ Her name was Louise. She was just a little bit older than I am when it happened. Oh, Jim.
L100947 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Acknowledged.
L100948 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here?
L100949 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, ut based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures.
L100950 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about Miri?
L100951 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they ente puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left.
L100952 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What about us?
L100953 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease.
L100954 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you.
L100955 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain.
L100956 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are You certain about the time we have left?
L100957 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I presume my calculations are correct.
L100958 +++$+++ u1073 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FARRELL  +++$+++ Landing party, this is the Enterprise.

L100969 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is a very good question.
L100970 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I've got to find Janice.
L100971 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators.
L100972 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers.
L100973 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We've got to have those communicators, Jim.
L100974 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's what the computers will tell us.
L100975 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Without them, it could be a beaker full of death.

L101009 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed.
L101010 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock?

L101012 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl?
L101013 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It occurred. I dismissed it.
L101014 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You would.
L101015 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering?
L101016 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Miste Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink.

L101023 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were ove eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law.
L101024 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I've heard of it.
L101025 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The emainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics.
L101026 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Unfortunately, he wasn't the first.
L101027 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy. Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Ove four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died. Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos? There never was a positive identification of his body.
L101028 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What has Karidian to do with it?
L101029 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.
L101030 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?
L101031 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them. With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near when they died.
L101032 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm not sure I can.

L101037 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to see that report.
L101038 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ When I've finished logging it.

L101041 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Can we predict the same for you, Captain?
L101042 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it.
L101043 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.
L101044 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right.
L101045 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Someone tried to kill him.
L101046 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Could have been an accident.
L101047 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you did. I got the same information.
L101048 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My personal business,
L101049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship.
L101050 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You think that happened?
L101051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It could happen.
L101052 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And you also know that nothing is proven.
L101053 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you invite death?
L101054 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done efore. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos.
L101055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He is.
L101056 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, but they may rest easier.
L101057 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise.
L101058 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea may prove

L101166 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock?
L101167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.
L101168 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a tribal culture.
L101169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More likely a loose association of some sort.
L101170 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ We know enough. If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity. We can use that.
L101171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How, Mister Boma?
L101172 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving them an invitation to come down and slaughter us.
L101173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have fo life.
L101174 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ Well, we're practical about it. I say we hit them before they hit us.
L101175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Boma?
L101176 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Absolutely.
L101177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy?
L101178 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Seems logical to me.
L101179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life indiscriminately,
L101180 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ The majority.
L101181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Miste Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third course.
L101182 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ That could get us killed.
L101183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I think not. Doctor McCoy.
L101184 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes.
L101185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in any way possible. We'll be back shortly.
L101186 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Right.
L101187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets.
L101188 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ Now you're talking.
L101189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill.
L101190 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer!
L101191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the esponsibility will be mine. Follow me. </font></p throws his shield at them too. They move on a little way.)
L101192 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ The mists. I can't see them.
L101193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe. Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock.
L101194 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ I say we hit them dead on.
L101195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal.
L101196 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal.
L101197 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fire.  Cease fire.  They should think twice before bothering us again.
L101198 +++$+++ u1209 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GAETANO +++$+++ I still say we should have killed them.
L101199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done. Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano, you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship.  again)
L101200 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done. Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano, you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship.  again)
L101201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again.
L101202 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ It's dangerous, but it might work.
L101203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Go, Mister Scott.
L101204 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel supply.
L101205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply.
L101206 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence.
L101207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They would also seem to be our only hope.
L101208 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye.
L101209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yeoman, your phaser.
L101210 +++$+++ u1214 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MEARS +++$+++ But what if the creatures attack again?
L101211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with luck, we'll be gone.
L101212 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands. Not that we can maintain it long.
L101213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit afte that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor, your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott.
L101214 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we have that'll work. </font></p finally the giant creature comes for the helpless man) the marks in the ground. Spock picks up the dropped phaser)
L101215 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor.
L101216 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his phaser like nothing's happened at all.
L101217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And give this to Mister Scott in the event I don't return.
L101218 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Just where are you going?
L101219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please.
L101220 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they?
L101221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons. They should have fled.
L101222 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You mean they should have respected us?
L101223 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Of course.
L101224 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occu to you they might react emotionally, with anger?
L101225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability.
L101226 +++$+++ u1214 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MEARS +++$+++ Why haven't they done anything?
L101227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They're studying us, for the moment.
L101228 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Another prediction, Mister Spock?

L101232 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What now?
L101233 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile.
L101234 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock!
L101235 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Curious. Most illogical.
L101236 +++$+++ u1214 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MEARS +++$+++ We could use a little inspiration.
L101237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical decisions. And yet two men have died.
L101238 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ And you've brought our furry friends down on us.
L101239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated esentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole.  Mister Spock.

L101241 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How much longer, Mister Scott?
L101242 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ They're in good shape, but they won't lift us off, if that's what you're getting at.
L101243 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Will they electrify the exterior of this ship?
L101244 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That they will, Mister Spock!
L101245 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott?
L101246 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Ready, Mister Spock.
L101247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ All right. Go.  Again! Again!
L101248 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I daren't use any more. Not and be sure of ignition.
L101249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you continue draining the phasers.
L101250 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It must've worked.
L101251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ For the moment.
L101252 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ For the moment?
L101253 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be ack. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship.
L101254 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Mister Gaetano's body's back there.
L101255 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It will of course have to be left behind.
L101256 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Not without a burial.
L101257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away.
L101258 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ Not without a burial, Mister Spock.
L101259 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril.
L101260 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's enough!

L101263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How about weight?
L101264 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ If we shed every ounce, we might be able to achieve orbit.
L101265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And how long can we hold it?
L101266 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ A few hours, no longer. But if we time it right, we can cut out of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled re=entry.
L101267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility.
L101268 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ We have very few alternatives, Mister Spock.
L101269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott?
L101270 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right.
L101271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You have that long to bury Mister Gaetano.

L101294 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic.
L101295 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Miste Scott. Fuel status?
L101296 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ You mean a burn-up?
L101297 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is the usual end of a decaying orbit.
L101298 +++$+++ u1214 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MEARS +++$+++ I don't want to die up here.
L101299 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on the planet's surface, I should think.
L101300 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Mister Spock, you said a while ago that there were always alternatives.
L101301 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did l? I may have been mistaken.
L101302 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there anything we can do?
L101303 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I fo one do not believe in angels.
L101304 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command.
L101305 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. My first command.
L101306 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Orbit attitude, Mister Spock. With our present fuel, that gives us about forty five minutes.
L101307 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please.
L101308 +++$+++ u1098 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOMA +++$+++ We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out of your mind?

L101312 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it was all human.
L101313 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Totally illogical. There was no chance.

L101316 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There's really something I don't understand about all of this. Maybe you can explain it to me. Logically, of course. When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would seem to me to be an act of desperation.
L101317 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite correct, Captain.
L101318 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does you well-known logic explain that?
L101319 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at.
L101320 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst.
L101321 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts.
L101322 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human emotional act?
L101323 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir.
L101324 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man.

L101336 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ That answer is based on your mechanical survey of the Enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial, is it not?
L101337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L101338 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Now the stardate
L101339 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But the computer is inaccurate, never the less.
L101340 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L101341 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red Alert.
L101342 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ In other words, it reports that Captain Kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist.
L101343 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And that is impossible.
L101344 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Is it? Were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button?
L101345 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert.
L101346 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Then how can you dispute the finding of the log?
L101347 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong.
L101348 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Oh? On what do you base that statement?
L101349 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I know the Captain. He is in
L101350 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ Please instruct the witness not to speculate.
L101351 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen.
L101352 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ I do not see what that has to
L101353 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do. It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic o malice. It is not his nature.
L101354 +++$+++ u1170 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SHAW +++$+++ In your opinion.
L101355 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. In my opinion.
L101356 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We'll need somebody in the pod for readings.
L101357 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain.
L101358 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Post him.
L101359 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion plates.
L101360 +++$+++ u1093 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FINNEY  +++$+++ Message Received.

L101363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Acknowledged.
L101364 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk here.
L101365 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L101366 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, I had to see it to believe it.
L101367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Explain.
L101368 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're sitting here playing chess with the computer.
L101369 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is true.
L101370 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known.
L101371 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game.
L101372 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's impossible.
L101373 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four.
L101374 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Bishop, half level right.
L101375 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine.  Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not accept that, however.
L101376 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ So you tested the programme bank.
L101377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The est I should have been able to attain was a draw.
L101378 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, why are you just sitting there?

L101380 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COGLEY +++$+++ And I repeat, I speak of rights. A machine has none. A man must. My client has the right to face his accuser, and if you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine. Indeed, you have elevated that machine above us. I ask that my motion be granted, and more than that, gentlemen. In the name of humanity, fading in the shadow of the machine, I demand it. I demand it! Enterprise.
L101381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Five in all.
L101382 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COGLEY +++$+++ May that be considered unusual?
L101383 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L101384 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COGLEY +++$+++ Why?
L101385 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the est that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate afte stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, eithe accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer.
L101386 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COGLEY +++$+++ Hypothetically, Mister Spock. Hypothetically, Miss Shaw. If what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond the capabilities of most men. Is that true?
L101387 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L101388 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COGLEY +++$+++ What man aboard ship would it not be beyond?
L101389 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Captain, myself, and the records officer.
L101390 +++$+++ u1162 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COGLEY +++$+++ And at the moment, you have no records officer.
L101391 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney.
L101392 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ready, Mister Spock?
L101393 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative, Captain.

L101420 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've checked everywhere.

L101422 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's right.

L101443 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take command.

L101451 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?
L101452 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command officers. Since there are only two of that rank available
L101453 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command ank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christophe Pike.
L101454 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
L101455 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.
L101456 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ We didn't have the heart to retire him, Jim. He's got you. Whatever he's up to, he's planned it well. entered a plea of guilty. against you should this vessel enter the Talos star group?

L101458 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Why? What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain Pike there? I want to know why.
L101459 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are your comments a part of the record, sir?
L101460 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Yes, it's on the record.
L101461 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.
L101462 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ For what purpose?
L101463 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain the importance of going to Talos Four.
L101464 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Present your evidence. Screen on.
L101465 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander, Captain Christopher Pike.

L101467 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way.
L101468 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen?  That's impossible. Mister Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that detail, that perfect. What were we watching?
L101469 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot tell you at this time, sir.
L101470 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Captain Pike, were any record tapes of this nature made during your voyage?  The court is not obliged to view evidence without knowing its source.
L101471 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask that question.
L101472 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NUMBER ONE  +++$+++ No. It's something else. There's still something out there.
L101473 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on outine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At first we were not certain what it was.
L101474 +++$+++ u1142 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NUMBER ONE +++$+++ We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
L101475 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S.S. Columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
L101476 +++$+++ u1222 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here.
L101477 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Sola system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.

L101479 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We aren't going to go, to be certain?
L101480 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOYCE +++$+++ Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers. The living and the dying.
L101481 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. unless. The message faded at that point, sir.
L101482 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Screen off. Mister Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical prowess in somehow manufacturing all this. I congratulate you on you imagination. But this is a court of space law, not a theatre.
L101483 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago?  Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control.
L101484 +++$+++ u1070 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GEOLOGIST +++$+++ Geological lab report complete, Captain.

L101486 +++$+++ u1095 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?
L101487 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L101488 +++$+++ u1137 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NUMBER ONE  +++$+++ Landing party, come in.
L101489 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?
L101490 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Receiving transmissions from Talos Four? Then the images we've een seeing are
L101491 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are coming from Talos Four, sir.
L101492 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Mister Spock, you're aware of the orders regarding any contact with Talos Four. You have deliberately invited the death penalty. You've not only finished yourself, Spock, but you've finished you Captain as well.
L101493 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of this.
L101494 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ And you're aware a Captain is responsible for everything that occurs on his ship. I order you to return this vessel back to manual control.
L101495 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, I respectfully decline.
L101496 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?
L101497 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, Jim, please don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the transmission.

L101501 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course.

L101505 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss.
L101506 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?
L101507 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmembe aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three.

L101525 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person.
L101526 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.  What do you make of that?
L101527 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely esembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of course.
L101528 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock.
L101529 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same asic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.

L101531 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured.

L101536 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ McCoy's death is a scientific fact.
L101537 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless. Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described?
L101538 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.

L101543 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which supports a theory I've been formulating.
L101544 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.
L101545 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us.

L101549 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just fo example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger

L101557 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I tend to agree.

L101559 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for.
L101560 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Indeed we did, Mister Spock.
L101561 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most illogical.

L101657 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I hardly find that fitting.

L101665 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides come down.

L101697 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Any word from the Enterprise?
L101698 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ They hit us a full day before you got there, Captain. No messages came from us, Captain. Why did they do it? Why? Why did they do it? There has to be a reason. There has to be a reason!

L101700 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation. Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open.
L101701 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof
L101702 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.
L101703 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations
L101704 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate. Invasion.
L101705 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.
L101706 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a complete record of this. Mister Spock, what do we have on this general area?
L101707 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations. There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels. However, none has ever been recorded.
L101708 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Anything on intelligent life forms?
L101709 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like space legends.
L101710 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Something the matter, Mister Spock?
L101711 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain.
L101712 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?
L101713 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?
L101714 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course.
L101715 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient. Destruction might be unnecessary.
L101716 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock.
L101717 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim.
L101718 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking othe Federation installations.
L101719 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life
L101720 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear?
L101721 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very clear, Captain.
L101722 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L101723 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would appear someone is curious about us.
L101724 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phase anks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu, continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer. Computers will control attack.

L101736 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK  +++$+++ The Enterprise is dead in space, stopped cold during he pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid, facing the Captain of the alien ship. Weaponless, I face the creature the Metrons called a Gorn. Large, reptilian. Like most humans, I seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles. I must fight to emember that this is an intelligent, highly advanced individual, the Captain of a starship, like myself, undoubtedly a dangerously cleve opponent.  eak off a twig. Their first physical engagement is uneven. Kirk is more agile than the reptile but nowhere near as strong. He boxes the Gorn's ears to get out of a bear-hug and runs up into the rocks looking for weapons. He throws a heavy rock at the Gorn, but it just bounces off his chest. When a boulder gets flung at him in return, Kirk etreats. Quickly.)

L101738 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, sir. It does no good.
L101739 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse engines directly.
L101740 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I tried that, sir. Nothing.
L101741 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here?
L101742 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ No, sir. They report they definitely emanate from that sola system ahead.
L101743 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic? Electronic?
L101744 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What are you going to do, Mister Spock?
L101745 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do.
L101746 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What about the Captain?
L101747 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If I could help him, I would. I cannot.
L101748 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What about some logic now? Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?
L101749 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him. suitable clubs. He carries on gaining height.

L101751 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But it has happened, Doctor.

Finally the diamonds go in, and a piece of torn trouser will serve as a fuse, once he can raise a spark from a stone and the translating device. Fire is created as the Gorn approaches him from behind. Seeing the danger, he braces the cannon and fires it. The explosion blows the bamboo apart, and also incapacitates his opponent.

L101787 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity.

L101793 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside.
L101794 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup?
L101795 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain.
L101796 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Explanation.
L101797 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ None.
L101798 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship?
L101799 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possible. Very possible.
L101800 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any further magnetic disturbance?
L101801 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal.
L101802 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Nothing?
L101803 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable y any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us.
L101804 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent.
L101805 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir?
L101806 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, find anything?
L101807 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest?
L101808 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a humanoid.
L101809 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered e-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to.
L101810 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations. Why do you give credence to this man?
L101811 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar.
L101812 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you identify that?
L101813 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm trying, Captain.
L101814 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L101815 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot.
L101816 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ He'll kill us all if we don't kill him first! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! which has struck the Enterprise and all sections of the galaxy once again. As for Lazarus, the story he tells me about the humanoid continues to trouble me.
L101817 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first.

L101819 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude?
L101820 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hard to believe.
L101821 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed.
L101822 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something.
L101823 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L101824 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power.
L101825 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations.

L101829 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Something quite extraordinary.
L101830 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Screen on, sir.

L101832 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before?
L101833 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Because it is not there.
L101834 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you?
L101835 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect.
L101836 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But it is there.
L101837 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may e described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in ou universe.
L101838 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A what?
L101839 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of ou established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it.
L101840 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Yes! That's it! The dilithium crystals. With their power we could do it.
L101841 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You refer to the humanoid?
L101842 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I tell you we're dealing with a creature capable of destroying worlds.
L101843 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why does he need the crystals? For what reason?
L101844 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock?
L101845 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unable to locate the source of radiation.
L101846 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise.
L101847 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It has simply disappeared, Captain.
L101848 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere. Not this time.  quick seizure.) unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid.
L101849 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that ou ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter.
L101850 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet.
L101851 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Correct. Which would seem to be impossible.
L101852 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are the instruments in order?
L101853 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perfect working condition.
L101854 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source of radiation is not from our universe.
L101855 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside.
L101856 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time.
L101857 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain.
L101858 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours?
L101859 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale.
L101860 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Which is what we've been experiencing. The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole?
L101861 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape
L101862 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected.
L101863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion.
L101864 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus?
L101865 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, ational. Almost as if he were two men.
L101866 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the universe. No, not a hole, A door.
L101867 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass.
L101868 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull.
L101869 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again.
L101870 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Which is physically impossible for one man.
L101871 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him.
L101872 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose?
L101873 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal. He must be stopped, held. Destroyed if necessary.
L101874 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't follow you.
L101875 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the othe negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter.
L101876 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out. violently.
L101877 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet
L101878 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Like Lazarus. Identical. Like both Lazarus', only one is matte and the other antimatter. If they meet.

L101901 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries. Engineering reports warp engines non-operational. Mister Scott overrode the automatic helm setting and is holding us in orbit on impulse power.

L101903 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us on in the same direction.

L101905 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain. Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape velocity.

L101907 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Apparently, Captain, so are we.
L101908 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What?
L101909 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments.

L101921 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain. Shall we turn off the tractor beam?
L101922 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ You seem to have a lot of them. However, I can't deny the fact that you're here. With this ship. </font></p
L101923 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Neither have I.
L101924 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant Commander Spock.
L101925 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L101926 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Interesting is a word and a half for it, Captain.
L101927 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Ou deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines.
L101928 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind?
L101929 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain Christopher.
L101930 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about him?
L101931 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations. and in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain, you and I and all that we know might not even exist.
L101932 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That flight suit must be uncomfortable.  Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters.
L101933 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir. </font></p
L101934 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired.
L101935 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will equire an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a Starbase.
L101936 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate.
L101937 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.
L101938 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ I take it that a lady computer is not routine.
L101939 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance. Cygnet Fourteen is a planet dominated by women. They seemed to feel the ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female, of course.
L101940 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Well then my disappearance would change something, too.
L101941 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher.

L101945 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher. Important I see you both immediately.
L101946 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher.
L101947 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Yes, sir. Bridge out.
L101948 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Yeah. I see physical training is required in your service, too.
L101949 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Crude methods, but effective.
L101950 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock?
L101951 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I made an error in my computations.
L101952 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Oh? This could be an historic occasion.
L101953 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth afte all.
L101954 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Why? You said I made no relative contribution.
L101955 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial un-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant
L101956 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You mean yet.
L101957 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher to go to Saturn.
L101958 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That means those search parties will be crawling all over that wreckage.
L101959 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.
L101960 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly.
L101961 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane. It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine UFO. Possibly alien, definitely destructive.
L101962 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us ack to our own time?
L101963 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us. Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now.
L101964 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Perhaps.
L101965 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a UFO.

L101987 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory.
L101988 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT  +++$+++ Aye, sir. Engine room out.
L101989 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Poor photography.
L101990 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one.
L101991 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room. </font></p simple question. Give me a simple answer. Nobody saw you. You got all the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it?
L101992 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That ought to be just about right. </font></p time for someone to get there.
L101993 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms?
L101994 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Yes, but you're not going to get them unless you take me with you.
L101995 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I can't do that, Captain.
L101996 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him.
L101997 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me. The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief.
L101998 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Shall I issue phasers?
L101999 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force.
L102000 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ You don't trust me, Spock.
L102001 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In fact, I do. But only to a certain point. </font></p
L102002 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, I do. What's he doing here?
L102003 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the ase. It was necessary to bring him along.
L102004 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Over my dead body.
L102005 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suspected he might not wish to return with us.
L102006 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER +++$+++ Slingshot effects are fine for you people. How do you propose to return the Sergeant and me?
L102007 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll egin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, eyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened.
L102008 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.
L102009 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase.
L102010 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry.
L102011 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
L102012 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ It's maximum now, sir. She's fighting it.
L102013 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We've broken free and heading back.
L102014 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Gaining speed now, Captain. We're now at warp four, warp seven. Eight. Off the dial, sir.
L102015 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Chronometers moving forward again, Captain.
L102016 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to eturn Captain Christopher and the guard?
L102017 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computed.
L102018 +++$+++ u1053 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHRISTOPHER  +++$+++ Everything A-OK. </font></p
L102019 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close.
L102020 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energise.
L102021 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

L102024 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise.
L102025 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Now.
L102026 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's our reading, Mister Spock?
L102027 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now.
L102028 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Engines cutting back, sir. No decrease in speed.
L102029 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Forty, thirty.
L102030 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Materialisation completed. Kirk out.  He bows politely and carries on his way.)
L102031 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant contentment.
L102032 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I said we're not going anywhere.
L102033 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience. How did you know?
L102034 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action.
L102035 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your analysis seems logical.
L102036 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ HACOM +++$+++ Landru.
L102037 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism.
L102038 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What do you make of all this?
L102039 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now
L102040 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ REGER +++$+++ Landru. He's summoning the body.
L102041 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Telepathy, Captain.
L102042 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A lighting panel.
L102043 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Amazing in this culture.
L102044 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ REGER +++$+++ Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as six thousand years.
L102045 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this. Inconsistent with this environment
L102046 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock?
L102047 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions.
L102048 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ REGER +++$+++ Those like you and me, who resist Landru.
L102049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An underground? How are you organised?
L102050 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they?
L102051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.
L102052 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT  +++$+++ Impossible to break away. I've tried the emergency bypass circuits but they haven't been effective.
L102053 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L102054 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it?
L102055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this direction.
L102056 +++$+++ u1096 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ REGER +++$+++ Landru.
L102057 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Block them out.
L102058 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Block them out.
L102059 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked.
L102060 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LANDRU +++$+++ I am Landru.
L102061 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Projection, Captain. Unreal.
L102062 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LANDRU +++$+++ The good must transcend the evil. It shall be done. So it has een since the beginning.
L102063 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He doesn't hear you, Captain.
L102064 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley.
L102065 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Where's Doctor McCoy?
L102066 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Miste O'Neil.
L102067 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I should say they've been here and been removed.
L102068 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Where is here?
L102069 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed?
L102070 +++$+++ u1032 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LINDSTROM +++$+++ Oh, does my head ache.
L102071 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.
L102072 +++$+++ u1032 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LINDSTROM +++$+++ Oh, is that what it was?
L102073 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious.
L102074 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected?
L102075 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Thei eaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data.
L102076 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human?
L102077 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps.  leaves them again.)
L102078 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ We all know one another and Landru.
L102079 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Like Sulu.
L102080 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAWGIVER +++$+++ Then you will die.
L102081 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go.
L102082 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAWGIVER +++$+++ Come.
L102083 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him?
L102084 +++$+++ u1032 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LINDSTROM +++$+++ Well?
L102085 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control.
L102086 +++$+++ u1032 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LINDSTROM +++$+++ Are we just going to stand here?
L102087 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door.
L102088 +++$+++ u1032 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LINDSTROM +++$+++ Well, this is simply ridiculous. A bunch of stone age characters running around in robes.
L102089 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension. Not simple, not ridiculous. Very, very dangerous.
L102090 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MARPLON +++$+++ Have no fear, friend. The effect is harmless. My name is Marplon. I was too late to save your first two friends. They have been absorbed. Beware of them.
L102091 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What about the Captain?
L102092 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MARPLON +++$+++ He is unharmed, unchanged. I am the third man in Reger's triad. We have been awaiting your return.
L102093 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are not Archons, Marplon.
L102094 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MARPLON +++$+++ Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of prophecy. We ask your help.
L102095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Where is Reger?
L102096 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MARPLON +++$+++ He will join us. He is immune to absorption. Hurry. We have not much time.
L102097 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Who is Landru?
L102098 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MARPLON +++$+++ Behave as you saw your Captain behave. It is done.

L102100 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Peace and tranquillity to you.  Are you all right?
L102101 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy.
L102102 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I understand. Landru.
L102103 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am formulating a theory, Captain.
L102104 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And?
L102105 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not here. The doctor.
L102106 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ My friends.  What is your theory, Mister Spock?
L102107 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark. All is indeed peace and tranquillity. The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine. All parts working in unison.

L102111 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense.

L102114 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Landru must die.
L102115 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference.
L102116 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Never mind what the prophecy says. If you want to be liberated from Landru, we'll need your help.

L102123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Useless, Captain. A projection.
L102124 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course. It had to be. Landru.
L102125 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection. Peace, harmony.
L102126 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LANDRU +++$+++ Your statement is irrelevant. You will be obliterated. The good of the Body is the Prime Directive.
L102127 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key.
L102128 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity. Without creativity, there is no life. The body dies. The fault is yours.
L102129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it?
L102130 +++$+++ u1202 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAWGIVER +++$+++ Landru! Guide us, Landru!
L102131 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the first time in their lives.
L102132 +++$+++ u1143 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LANDRU +++$+++ Peace, order, and tranquillity are maintained. The body lives, ut I reserve creativity to me.
L102133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of the Body.
L102134 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MARPLON +++$+++ Is this truly Landru?
L102135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago.
L102136 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What?
L102137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings.
L102138 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But only a machine, Mister Spock. The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock.
L102139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable.
L102140 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You'd make a splendid computer, Mister Spock.
L102141 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is very kind of you, Captain.
L102142 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sounds most promising. Good luck.

L102144 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ I have my orders, Captain, and now you have yours. You will proceed on course. Achieve orbit status and just leave the rest to me.

L102145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest
L102146 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Anything else?
L102147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its mission. The USS Valiant. Listed as missing in space.

L102153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit. Obviously, they know we're here.

L102224 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Origin?
L102225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights into this sector for years.
L102226 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We're reading it, Lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel.
L102227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong.
L102228 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class.
L102229 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s.
L102230 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic.
L102231 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens.

L102234 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of espiration.

L102237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War.

L102244 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years.
L102245 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip?
L102246 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel
L102247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion.
L102248 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh?
L102249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have een dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships.
L102250 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours.
L102251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none.
L102252 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And that irritates you, Mister Spock.
L102253 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Irritation?
L102254 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yeah.
L102255 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am not capable of that emotion.
L102256 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ My apologies, Mister Spock. You suspect some danger in them?
L102257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain.
L102258 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Make course for Starbase Twelve.

L102261 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I note he's making considerable use of our technical library.
L102262 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding?
L102263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations.
L102264 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves.
L102265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability eeds superior ambition.
L102266 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons.
L102267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated.
L102268 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That fact isn't in the history texts.
L102269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty Napoleons might still be alive? </font></p
L102270 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Forgive my curiosity, Mister Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey.
L102271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And how you managed to keep it out of the history books.
L102272 +++$+++ u1173 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ Adventure, Captain. Adventure. There was little else left on Earth.
L102273 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort.
L102274 +++$+++ u1173 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ Tyranny, sir? Or an attempt to unify humanity?
L102275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip?
L102276 +++$+++ u1173 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ I know something of those years. Remember, it was a time of great dreams, of great aspiration.
L102277 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Under dozens of petty dictatorships.
L102278 +++$+++ u1173 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KHAN +++$+++ One man would have ruled eventually. As Rome under Caesar. Think of its accomplishments.
L102279 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then your sympathies were with

L102323 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor, you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed long enough, he dies.
L102324 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK  +++$+++ Sulu had the same observation. Any explanations?
L102325 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive. </font></p
L102326 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately ecorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed. </font></p
L102327 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays.
L102328 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ That can be explained.
L102329 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Please do.

L102332 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ And I never understood you. Until now. There was always a place in here where no one could come. There was only the face you allow people to see. Only one side you'd allow them to know.
L102333 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here.
L102334 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ I missed you.
L102335 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logically, you should all be dead.
L102336 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ If I tell you how we survived, will you try to understand how we feel about our life here? About each other?
L102337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist.
L102338 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ It's not much further.
L102339 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.

L102363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out.

L102367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?
L102368 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship.

L102373 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a drink, Jim.
L102374 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Where did they originate?
L102375 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays. The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit.
L102376 +++$+++ u1074 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ELIAS +++$+++ We have no need or want, Captain.
L102377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love.

L102379 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner o later. Join us. Please.
L102380 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. No! I can't leave!  Emotions. Violent emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable isk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being. Aroused, his great physical strength could kill. But it's a risk I'll have to take.
L102381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spock here.
L102382 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK  +++$+++ It's Jim.

L102384 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting. </font></p
L102385 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you want me to beam up a party? </font></p
L102386 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ I'll wait.
L102387 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ready to beam up, Jim. </font></p
L102388 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship.
L102389 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man.
L102390 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid.
L102391 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim, I don't understand.
L102392 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to understand. All you have is printed circuits.
L102393 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, if you'll excuse me.
L102394 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia?
L102395 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador.
L102396 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.
L102397 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, please don't
L102398 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core, otten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl.
L102399 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's enough.
L102400 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours. Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about. It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times.
L102401 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You did that to me deliberately.
L102402 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one.
L102403 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore.
L102404 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock.
L102405 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical.
L102406 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and oadcast over the communicator?
L102407 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It can be done.
L102408 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. Let's get to work.
L102409 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.
L102410 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter?
L102411 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is quite logical, Captain. </font></p
L102412 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, now, I think I can fix that for you. Enterprise? </font></p
L102413 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Enterprise. Spock here. </font></p
L102414 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Enterprise. Spock here. </font></p
L102415 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. </font></p
L102416 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. </font></p
L102417 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there? </font></p there. Out.
L102418 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores?
L102419 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'll be back shortly, Captain. </font></p
L102420 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ You're no longer with us, are you? I felt something was wrong.
L102421 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It was necessary.
L102422 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ Come back to the planet with me. You can belong again. Come back with me, please.
L102423 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I can't.
L102424 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ I love you. I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop epeating myself. On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself. You couldn't even put your arms around me. We couldn't have anything together there. We couldn't have anything together anyplace else. We're happy here.  I can't lose you now, Mister Spock. I can't.
L102425 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge. I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's.
L102426 +++$+++ u1099 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LEILA +++$+++ And this is for my good? Do you mind if I say I still love you? You never told me if you had another name, Mister Spock.
L102427 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You couldn't pronounce it. </font></p
L102428 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin.
L102429 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes. </font></p
L102430 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We haven't heard much from you about Omicron Ceti Three, Miste Spock.
L102431 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy. </font> </p
L102432 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ First, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to almost disintegrate. Metal began dissolving away. There was no reason for it, and our chemists were unable to analyse the corrosive agent.
L102433 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been discovered.
L102434 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Volcanic activity?
L102435 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain.
L102436 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ Ed shot it.
L102437 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oh. You mean shot at it.
L102438 +++$+++ u1158 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ APPEL +++$+++ No. I mean shot it. With this.
L102439 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L102440 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ You'll get it.
L102441 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Miste Vanderberg, what is this?
L102442 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ It's a silicon nodule. There are a millions of them are down there. No commercial value.
L102443 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon?
L102444 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.&nbsp;
L102445 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed.
L102446 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production going again. We must have that pergium.
L102447 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we could force another appearance of this creature
L102448 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ Something's happening in the reactor room! </font></p
L102449 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive. Traces may linger.
L102450 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ The main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone.
L102451 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive.
L102452 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, on board?
L102453 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain.
L102454 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet?
L102455 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem so.
L102456 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years.
L102457 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't know. But there is a possibility.
L102458 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's that?
L102459 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element? For instance, silicon.
L102460 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon. A silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order. It's possible that our phasers might not affect it.
L102461 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phase two.
L102462 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating.
L102463 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one.
L102464 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But our people have phaser number two.
L102465 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon.
L102466 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere.
L102467 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment.
L102468 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on. Mister Spock, have Lieutenant Commander Giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser number two. You make the prope adjustments. You seem fascinated by this rock.
L102469 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature.
L102470 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do they tie in?
L102471 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't know.
L102472 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Speculate.
L102473 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause fo amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time.

L102475 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office.
L102476 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must. It is vitally important we get this installation back into production.
L102477 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon?
L102478 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock? Find something?
L102479 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain. Interesting.
L102480 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Traces?

L102485 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He never even had a chance to fire, Captain.
L102486 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature must still be around.
L102487 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L102488 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L102489 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour. Moments ago, in fact.
L102490 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you certain?
L102491 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Positive.
L102492 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers.
L102493 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss.  it. The shaggy creature shuffles off back into another of its nice circular tunnels and vanishes.)
L102494 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Gone.
L102495 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly.
L102496 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ These walls are hot.
L102497 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes.
L102498 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go?
L102499 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction.
L102500 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's not animal tissue. What is it?
L102501 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain.
L102502 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then your guess was right.
L102503 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem so. Silicon-based.
L102504 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Summation.
L102505 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air.
L102506 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That would account for the tunnels.
L102507 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive.
L102508 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber.
L102509 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And it explains the murdered men.
L102510 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. No, it might require amassed phasers.
L102511 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Or a single phaser with much longer contact.
L102512 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it, Mister Spock?
L102513 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all.
L102514 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ One creature in a hundred miles?
L102515 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime.
L102516 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite you tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span.
L102517 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science.
L102518 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. This is not a zoological expedition. Maintain a constant reading on the creature. If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels. We'll try to surround it. I'm sorry, Mister Spock, ut I'm afraid the creature must die.
L102519 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity. The search team is gathering in the main tunnel.
L102520 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous. Stay in pairs. If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to e its head. Concentrate it. Maintain it. It is definitely resistant, ut it can be hurt. And if it can be hurt, it can be killed. Miste Spock.
L102521 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one. This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it.
L102522 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order.
L102523 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose
L102524 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and that's the end of it.
L102525 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, sir.
L102526 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump.
L102527 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ II beg your pardon, sir?
L102528 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation. Your scientific knowledge
L102529 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than I do. You're aware of that.
L102530 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, you are second in command. This will be a dangerous hunt. Either one of us by himself is expendable. Both of us are not.
L102531 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both eing killed are 2,228.7 to 1.
L102532 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ 2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock.
L102533 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And they are of course accurate, Captain.
L102534 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course. Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. But please stay out of trouble, Mister Spock.
L102535 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is always my intention, Captain.
L102536 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L102537 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, we are being watched.
L102538 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you sure? Intuition?
L102539 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir. We're being watched.
L102540 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir. We're being watched.
L102541 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels.
L102542 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. You take the left. I'll take the right.
L102543 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Should we separate?
L102544 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Two tunnels, two of us. We separate.  move through one of the new circular tunnels. Further on, Kirk's tunnel ecomes circular too, then it opens into an area with flat floor, equipment and silicon nodules.)

L102548 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, no! Don't shoot. Come on over, Mister Spock.
L102549 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. It's made no moves against you?
L102550 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, they're all through here, all over the place. Thousands of them.
L102551 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, I see.
L102552 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Does it means something to you?
L102553 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds.
L102554 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You think you can get through to that thing?
L102555 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's possible.
L102556 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental arriers but if there's a chance

L102559 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Pain! Pain! Pain!  That's all I got, Captain. Waves and waves of searing pain. It's in agony.
L102560 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No kill I. What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us?
L102561 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, ut not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta.
L102562 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A Horta. A Horta! Mister Spock, we need that retardation mechanism. You must re-establish communications with it.
L102563 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet.
L102564 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Never mind. Just come down to the twenty third level. You'll be led to us by tricorder readings. Kirk out.
L102565 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life. Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless.
L102566 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He's a healer, let him heal. Mister Spock, you must re-establish communications. I want to know why it suddenly took to murder.
L102567 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it.
L102568 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Go take a look.
L102569 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The end of life. Murderers.
L102570 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Miste Spock. Tell it we're trying to help. The mechanism.
L102571 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children.

L102574 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found the unit in there. It's in pretty good shape. I also found about a million of these silicon nodules. They're eggs, aren't they?
L102575 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch.
L102576 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs. Tell them, Mister Spock.
L102577 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, ut the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here is the mother of her race.
L102578 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ This is where they live. They digest rock, they tunnel fo nourishment.
L102579 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one.
L102580 +++$+++ u1126 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG +++$+++ Sounds all right, if it will work.
L102581 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die.
L102582 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with the Horta again. Tell her our proposition. She and her children can do all the tunnelling they want. Our people will remove the minerals, and each side will leave the other alone. Think she'll go for it?
L102583 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans, I find that curiously efreshing. </font></p
L102584 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Very good, Mister Spock.
L102585 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one.
L102586 +++$+++ u1028 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VANDERBERG  +++$+++ You know, the Horta aren't so bad once you're used to their appearance. </font></p
L102587 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance evolting, but she thought she could get used to it.
L102588 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any comment about those ears?
L102589 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have
L102590 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ She really liked those ears?
L102591 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste.
L102592 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Because she approved of you?
L102593 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Really, Captain, my modesty
L102594 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock. I suspect you're ecoming more and more human all the time.
L102595 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted.
L102596 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good.  We both guessed right. Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down. Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack. We are to proceed to Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons from using it as a base.
L102597 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the disputed area, ideally located for use by either side.

L102599 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures.

L102605 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very light.
L102606 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies.
L102607 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
L102608 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it.
L102609 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want.
L102610 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons.
L102611 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy.
L102612 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir.
L102613 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of.
L102614 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You'd think they had people beaming down every day.
L102615 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain. Quite large.
L102616 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle.
L102617 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the eports we've been given on this culture.

L102623 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register.
L102624 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That doesn't seem likely.
L102625 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in thei physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture.
L102626 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you verify that?
L102627 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development.
L102628 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army.

L102677 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would appear so, Captain.

L102690 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, what are the odds now?

L102703 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba.
L102704 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong.
L102705 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight. You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the odds.

L102811 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article.

L102814 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You must be mistaken. They both can't be true.
L102815 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to. KIRK: She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she

L102825 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits.
L102826 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War.
L102827 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement.

L102829 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world.

L102831 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim.
L102832 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How did she die? What day?
L102833 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry.

L102851 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning.

L102857 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The sun's gravimetric pull increasing.
L102858 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir.
L102859 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level.
L102860 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the asteroid belt for the miners and bringing cargo out. I've made the run a couple of times myself as an engineering advisor.
L102861 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No Federation contacts for over a year.
L102862 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva. He's a research biologist. That woman sounded like his wife Aurelan.
L102863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals. Sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface. However, they are strangely quiet. Very little activity.
L102864 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva. There's more than one hundred thousand in this city alone. Where is everyone?
L102865 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent.
L102866 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ My brother's lab is over there. They signalled us once. There should be someone there. Let's find out what's happening.
L102867 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, several people approaching.
L102868 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock?
L102869 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety.
L102870 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They tried to brain us with these clubs. Check them out, Bones.
L102871 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions.
L102872 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four.
L102873 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I understand how you must
L102874 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here. Your guess.
L102875 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not entirely successful.
L102876 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported. Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong here.
L102877 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it.
L102878 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him.
L102879 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out.
L102880 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ None, sir. Just that noise we heard.
L102881 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it.

L102885 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists.
L102886 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And it can bear up under full phaser power.
L102887 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard.

L102901 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me.  It wants this ship, but I am resisting.

L102904 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million colonists on that planet down there, just as much your responsibility. They need your help, too.

L102909 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before.
L102910 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Not likely, Mister Spock.
L102911 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is an order, Mister Scott.
L102912 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay.
L102913 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me.
L102914 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ He said he was transporting down to the surface, sir. You orders were that no one was to beam down unless you authorised it. And knowing Mister Spock's determination on some things, I thought I'd etter hold him here until I got your orders.
L102915 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me.
L102916 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running around. He should be in bed.
L102917 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed.
L102918 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him down. Stay in constant touch with us. Give him your phaser. He'll need that, too.

L102921 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting.  Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right.
L102922 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're fa from all right.
L102923 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell.
L102924 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. That would answer a lot of questions.
L102925 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain?
L102926 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact.
L102927 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons.
L102928 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy.
L102929 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain.
L102930 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But not impossible, Mister Spock. The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won. That's the angle to work on, gentlemen. I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour.
L102931 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L102932 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there. creatures without killing their human hosts, my command esponsibilities will force me to kill over a million people.
L102933 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more.
L102934 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people.
L102935 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew. Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people.
L102936 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Jim. We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test.
L102937 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me.
L102938 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Request denied.
L102939 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness.
L102940 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died. All right. All right. We've tried heat, radiation. What other qualities or properties does the sun have?
L102941 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy.
L102942 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Not to us. But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part. Suppose they weren't simply hiding. Suppose they're sensitive to light. Light, like in a sun, close up.
L102943 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A possibility.
L102944 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Miste Spock?
L102945 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium.
L102946 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Your figures are, of course, accurate.
L102947 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch.

L102949 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice.
L102950 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles.
L102951 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor.
L102952 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, are you all right?
L102953 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain.
L102954 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain.
L102955 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you.
L102956 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature. It wasn't necessary. I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it.
L102957 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see.
L102958 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim. Spock, I
L102959 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done.
L102960 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The blindness was temporary, Jim. There's something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's.
L102961 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix.
L102962 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most. You, I presume, felt nothing?
L102963 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me.
L102964 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If you gentlemen are finished, would you mind laying in a course for Starbase Ten, Mister Spock?
L102965 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My pleasure, Captain.
L102966 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first officer in the fleet.
L102967 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy.
L102968 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, keep it open. I don't like this. Nothing since the first check in. Scott and Sulu should've contacted us again a half an hou ago.
L102969 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They may have nothing to report. Our sensors indicate no life forms except our landing party.
L102970 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog.
L102971 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain. According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship.
L102972 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Readings, Mister Spock.
L102973 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form eadings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain.
L102974 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock?
L102975 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No change, Captain.
L102976 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. Comment?
L102977 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very bad poetry, Captain.
L102978 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A more useful comment, Mister Spock.
L102979 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What we've just seen is not real.
L102980 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's useful.
L102981 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but definitely registering.
L102982 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim.
L102983 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're inside, somewhere.
L102984 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference?
L102985 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference.
L102986 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.
L102987 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.
L102988 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us.
L102989 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Trick or treat, Captain?
L102990 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one day. Shall we have a look around?
L102991 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would seem to be in order.
L102992 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Straight ahead, Mister Spock?
L102993 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The readings would so indicate.
L102994 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. Are you all right?
L102995 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. I am undamaged, Captain.
L102996 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth manifestations. Why?
L102997 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are eal.
L102998 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a human nightmare.

L103012 +++$+++ u1227 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Captain Kirk. You wanted to know what we did to your men. Actually it's a simple matter for us to probe the minds of creatures like yourself.
L103013 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mind probing? Hypnosis?
L103014 +++$+++ u1227 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures, but you're flawed. One gains admittance to your minds through many levels. You have too many to keep track of yourselves. There are unguarded entrances to any human mind.

L103021 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar.
L103022 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Familiar. Startling. Not rational.
L103023 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious. The universal myths, symbols.
L103024 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ghosts, witches.
L103025 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness.

L103027 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious. Korob seemed puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided.
L103028 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He expected me to react as though it were all normal. Well, he admitted that they weren't native to this planet.
L103029 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy.
L103030 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like.

L103032 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the moment

L103115 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it?
L103116 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital. If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way. Clear, Spock?
L103117 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite clear, Captain.
L103118 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ If there's anything I could do to help, I would, and I will, ut we can expect nothing from the Companion. </font></p
L103119 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened. Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage.
L103120 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It attacked you?
L103121 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity.
L103122 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can e shorted out?
L103123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite correct, Doctor. </font></p
L103124 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite correct, Doctor. </font></p
L103125 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce. It cannot fail.
L103126 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ I don't want it killed.
L103127 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We may simply render it powerless.
L103128 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ What was it they used to call it? The Judas goat?
L103129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers.
L103130 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock?
L103131 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ All right.
L103132 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock.
L103133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain?
L103134 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The universal translator on the shuttlecraft. We can try that, talk to that thing.
L103135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
L103136 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's oring. Adjusting the translator will give you something to do.
L103137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception
L103138 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life. This device instantaneously compares the frequency of ainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and then provides the necessary grammar.
L103139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then it translates its findings into English.
L103140 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end. Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing eve is. Ready, Mister Spock?
L103141 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite ready, Captain.
L103142 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Feminine. No doubt about it.
L103143 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
L103144 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm way ahead of you.
L103145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then it is not a zookeeper.
L103146 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPANION +++$+++ Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration. There will be nothing to harm you. You will continue, and the man will continue. This is necessary.
L103147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history.
L103148 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here.
L103149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much.
L103150 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ I'm a what?
L103151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you.
L103152 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ You're as bad as it is.
L103153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. You elationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years een emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial.
L103154 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ Is this what the future holds? Men who have no notion of decency or morality? Maybe I'm a hundred and fifty years out of style, ut I'm not going to be fodder for any inhuman monster.
L103155 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude.
L103156 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it. Love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice. I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd let him go.
L103157 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to eact like a human.
L103158 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Both of us. Those you knew as the Commissioner and the Companion. We are both here.
L103159 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Companion, you do not have the power to create life.
L103160 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ That is for the Maker of all things.
L103161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commissioner Hedford was dying.
L103162 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ That part of us was too weak to hold on. In a moment, there would have been no continuing. Now we're together.
L103163 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you are both here, in the one body?
L103164 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ I can't take her away from here. If I do, she'll die. If I leave her, she'll die of loneliness. I owe everything to her. I can't leave her. I love her. Is that surprising?
L103165 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially irrational.
L103166 +++$+++ u1141 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COCHRANE +++$+++ I have honours enough.
L103167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality. You'll both grow old here and finally die.
L103168 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Analysis, gentlemen.
L103169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a large, well-armed landing party.
L103170 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, I mentioned that.
L103171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous.
L103172 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I understand.
L103173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain.
L103174 +++$+++ u1083 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Chur-ah.
L103175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment. </font></p
L103176 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ We have a distress call from a Federation ship under attack. That's where our duty lies. Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp five. contact our landing party before we were forced to answer the distress signal. Our inability to reach the landing party is strange and I am concerned.
L103177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters
L103178 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The Klingon ship.
L103179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would seem a logical conclusion.
L103180 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's a very good idea, Bones.
L103181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain, an excellent idea.
L103182 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in.
L103183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But a defensible entrance, Captain.
L103184 +++$+++ u1171 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ELEEN +++$+++ Even the women of our village cannot tell so much with a touch. Strange hand. Very soft.
L103185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out.
L103186 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills.
L103187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is enough loose rock and shale.
L103188 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of ou communicators?
L103189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Only a very slight chance it would work.
L103190 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try.
L103191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I didn't say that exactly.
L103192 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I didn't say that exactly.
L103193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide.  coming forward until the ock face explodes. Kras hides but other Capellans are crushed by the falling boulders. When the dust starts to clear, Kras takes the Federation phasers from a wounded Capellan then kills him with his own knife. The remaining members of the posse move on.)
L103194 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock.
L103195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand.
L103196 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ No. Say to yourself, The child is mine. It is mine. It is
L103197 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion.
L103198 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean it makes a good bowstring.
L103199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe I said that.
L103200 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ No, no, Mister Spock. You place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here to support its head.
L103201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you.
L103202 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'll explain later.
L103203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That should prove very interesting. </font></p
L103204 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone.
L103205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The child?
L103206 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery. I really thought she'd learned to want it.
L103207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the warriors.
L103208 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. Spock!
L103209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Here, Captain. Over here, Captain.  Spock to Enterprise.
L103210 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time anymore.
L103211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I must agree.
L103212 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There's just one thing I want.
L103213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Klingon?
L103214 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ One of us must get him.
L103215 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Revenge, Captain?
L103216 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take his little head like that. There, arm in a. That's it. See how easy? Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.
L103217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain?
L103218 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo. If you're curious, consult linguistics.
L103219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting.
L103220 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Interesting?
L103221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is actually Doctor McCoy's child.
L103222 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott.
L103223 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nor does Doctor McCoy.  y the young high chief's regent. Report follows.
L103224 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir.
L103225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The child's regent?
L103226 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Representing the high teer, Leonard James Akaar.
L103227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The child was named Leonard James Akaar?
L103228 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard. What do you think, Spock?
L103229 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month, sir.
L103230 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Preliminary reports, Mister Spock.
L103231 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Pollux Four. Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere. Sensors indicate no life forms. Approximate age fou illion years. Judged no reason for contact. In all respects, quite ordinary, Captain.
L103232 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Analysis, Mister Spock.
L103233 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Momentarily.
L103234 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand?
L103235 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. Not living tissue.
L103236 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A trick, then? A projection?
L103237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not a projection, sir. A field of energy.
L103238 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. Status.
L103239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It esembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths. Despite its appearance, that of a human appendage, it is definitely not living tissue. It is energy.
L103240 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Ineffective, Captain. There doesn't seem to be anything to push against.
L103241 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven.
L103242 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock.
L103243 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Screen on, Captain.
L103244 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell where this ship used to be.
L103245 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Verbose, isn't he?
L103246 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Insulted, Spock?
L103247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Insults are effective only where emotion is present.
L103248 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Mister Spock, I can't contact the landing party. All frequencies are jammed.
L103249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Try to break through it, Lieutenant.
L103250 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Transporter and communications?
L103251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits fo maximum power generation. Compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship.
L103252 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Working, sir.
L103253 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet.
L103254 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Aye sir.
L103255 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down there. </font></p
L103256 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Computed and standing by to generate, sir.
L103257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Activate all units.
L103258 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ No good, Mister Spock. We didn't even faze it. We're still locked tight.
L103259 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Cut power, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, we must restore communications with the landing party.
L103260 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this.
L103261 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oh?
L103262 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit.
L103263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle.
L103264 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ I've located the landing party, but one of them seems separated from the other four.
L103265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And Apollo?
L103266 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Mister Spock, here's something. There seems to be a radiated energy pulsation coming from the planet. I don't know what it is, sir.
L103267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Origin?
L103268 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ I can't seem to pinpoint it.
L103269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the power source is, you should find out where it is not. A simple process of elimination.
L103270 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take. </font></p
L103271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Progress report.
L103272 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I'm connecting the bypass circuit now, sir. It should take another half hour.
L103273 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Speed is essential, Lieutenant.
L103274 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Mister Spock, I haven't done anything like this in years. If it isn't done just right, I could blow the entire communications system. It's very delicate work, sir.
L103275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I can think no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura. Please proceed.
L103276 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Yes, sir. Right away.
L103277 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Progress, Mister Sulu?
L103278 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Sectors one through twenty five charted and examined. No chance at all of power originating in those areas.
L103279 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Continue the search.
L103280 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir. Fourteen B by twenty six index.
L103281 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Kyle.

L103283 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We're unable to break completely loose from this force field, ut we might be able to punch some holes through it.
L103284 +++$+++ u1116 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ What for, sir?
L103285 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines.
L103286 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Yes, sir. My orders and my duty.

L103292 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right. The temple is his power source. Let's bring him back to it. Get to cover. Mister Spock, fire those phasers.
L103293 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Captain, you're too close.
L103294 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ All phaser banks, maintain firing rate!

L103296 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock said that?

L103299 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it!
L103300 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it!
L103301 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet. On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of ut two point eight light days.
L103302 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, what the devil is this all about?
L103303 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no. </font></p
L103304 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no. </font></p
L103305 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers.
L103306 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years
L103307 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not?
L103308 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now?
L103309 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated.
L103310 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family
L103311 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. Nothing of that nature, Captain.
L103312 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent
L103313 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.
L103314 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong?
L103315 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer.
L103316 +++$+++ u1208 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU  +++$+++ Aye, sir.
L103317 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Captain.
L103318 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible.
L103319 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No.  We're not. e under stress. He has requested and been granted shore leave. Ship surgeon McCoy has him under medical surveillance.
L103320 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early. Don't worry. I'll see that you get your leave as soon as we're finished.
L103321 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I quite understand, Captain. </font></p
L103322 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. </font></p
L103323 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Changed the course?
L103324 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you deny it?
L103325 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible.
L103326 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then why'd you do it?
L103327 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further.
L103328 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm trying to help you, Spock.
L103329 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ask me no further questions. I will not answer.
L103330 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I order you to report to the Sickbay.
L103331 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sickbay?
L103332 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you.
L103333 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And now I'll go to my quarters.
L103334 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do. Come on, Spock. Yield to the logic of the situation.
L103335 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us. </font></p Vulcan again, and now we're headed back to Altair.
L103336 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth. No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk. </font></p
L103337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Come.
L103338 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of you condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What? Is it something only your planet can do for you? Spock! You've been called the best first officer in the fleet. That's an enormous asset to me. If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why.
L103339 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that, Captain, and understand?
L103340 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order.
L103341 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service.
L103342 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential?
L103343 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It has to do with biology.
L103344 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What?
L103345 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Biology.
L103346 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What kind of biology?
L103347 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcan biology.
L103348 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction? Well, there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mister Spock. It happens to the birds and the bees.
L103349 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ipped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose thei mates? Haven't you wondered?
L103350 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically.
L103351 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature, Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched. On your Earth, the salmon. They must return to that one stream where they were born, to spawn or die in trying.
L103352 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're
L103353 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife. Or die.
L103354 +++$+++ u1196 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA  +++$+++ Communication to Mister Spock. Lieutenant Uhura here. The captain asked me to
L103355 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Let me alone. Let me alone!
L103356 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend. Bridge. Navigation. </font></p take.
L103357 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Miss Chapel.
L103358 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock?
L103359 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures. Don't you think?
L103360 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ I don't understand.
L103361 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your face is wet.
L103362 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ I came to tell you that we are bound for Vulcan. We'll be there in just a few days.
L103363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcan. Miss Chapel.
L103364 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ My name is Christine.
L103365 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek soup?
L103366 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mister Spock. </font></p
L103367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful.
L103368 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness.
L103369 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony.
L103370 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is it permitted?
L103371 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends.
L103372 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Spock.
L103373 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I also request McCoy accompany me.
L103374 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VULCAN  +++$+++ USS Enterprise from Vulcan Space Central. Permission granted. And from all of Vulcan, welcome. Is Commander Spock with you?

L103377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place.
L103378 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ She's lovely, Mister Spock. Who is she?

L103381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years. This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee,
L103382 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I wonder when his T'Pring arrives.
L103383 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The marriage party approaches. I hear them.
L103384 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.
L103385 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal. One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts. In this way our minds were locked together, so that at the proper time, we would both be drawn to Koon-ut-kal-if-fee.  men enter shaking contraptions with lots of bells, followed by a woman carried on a chair. T'Pring and others come behind her.)
L103386 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ Spock, are our ceremonies for outworlders?
L103387 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted this.
L103388 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted this.
L103389 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is Kirk.
L103390 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ Thee names these out worlders friends. How does thee pledge their behaviour?
L103391 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ With my life, T'Pau.
L103392 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ Kirk? T'Pring is within her rights, but our laws and customs are not binding on thee. Thee are free to decline with no harm on thyself.
L103393 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ T'Pau.
L103394 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ Thee speaks?
L103395 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My friend does not understand.
L103396 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ The choice has been made, Spock. It is up to him now.
L103397 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend!
L103398 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin. Are thee Vulcan or are thee human?
L103399 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I plead with thee! I beg!
L103400 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party.  As strange as it may seem, Mister Spock, you're in command now. Any orders?
L103401 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities.  T'Pring. Explain.
L103402 +++$+++ u1254 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PRING +++$+++ Specify.
L103403 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as you champion.
L103404 +++$+++ u1254 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PRING +++$+++ Stonn wanted me, I wanted him.
L103405 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.
L103406 +++$+++ u1254 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PRING +++$+++ You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a legend. And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to e the consort of a legend. But by the laws of our people, I could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee. There was also Stonn, who wanted very much to be my consort, and I wanted him. If your Captain were victor, he would not want me, and so I would have Stonn. If you were victor you would free me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn. But if you did not free me, it would be the same. For you would be gone, and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be there.
L103407 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logical. Flawlessly logical.
L103408 +++$+++ u1254 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PRING +++$+++ I am honoured.
L103409 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper.
L103410 +++$+++ u1203 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ T'PAU +++$+++ Live long and prosper, Spock.
L103411 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend. Energize. </font></p
L103412 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, I
L103413 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
L103414 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, I
L103415 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel.
L103416 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Don't you think you better check with me first?
L103417 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain! Jim!  Chapel's own smiles are noticed)
L103418 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain! Jim!  Chapel's own smiles are noticed)
L103419 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at something of a loss to understand it, however.
L103420 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death.
L103421 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed.
L103422 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding?
L103423 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone.
L103424 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down. .
L103425 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain.
L103426 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock. I understand.
L103427 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Captain.
L103428 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical.
L103429 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor.
L103430 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Sir, we're now within the limits of System L-370, but I can't seem to locate
L103431 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed. Nothing left but rubble and asteroids.
L103432 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact. Only a nova could destroy like that.

L103479 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe I said that, Doctor.
L103480 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ It's veering off, back on course for the next solar system. The Rigel colony, sir.
L103481 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship eyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle ack to pick up the Captain.
L103482 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ You can't let that reach Rigel. Why, millions of innocent people would die.
L103483 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command.
L103484 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Our primary duty is to maintain life and safety of Federation planets. Do you deny that?
L103485 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation.
L103486 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Belay that last order, helmsman. One hundred and eighty degree turn, hard about. We're going to attack.
L103487 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu.
L103488 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Mister Spock, I'm officially notifying you that I'm exercising my option under regulations as a Starfleet Commodore, and that I am assuming command of the Enterprise.
L103489 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it.
L103490 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ That thing must be destroyed.
L103491 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew.
L103492 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ I made a mistake then. We were too far away. This time I'm going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range.
L103493 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single ship cannot combat it.
L103494 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ So are you, sir. Well, Spock?
L103495 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states
L103496 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when you know he's wrong!
L103497 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C.
L103498 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'll certify that right now.
L103499 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it.
L103500 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him.
L103501 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then your statement would not be considered valid.
L103502 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, we can cross-connect the controls, but it'll make the ship almost impossible for one man to handle. </font></p
L103503 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Deflector shields at full power. They can't take much more of this.
L103504 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir.

L103506 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Direct hit. It just bounced off.
L103507 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal.
L103508 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Sir, Deck seven reports power failure in main energisers. Implementing emergency procedures.  Severe casualties reported on decks three and four. Damage control party sealing off inner hull rupture.
L103509 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It has ceased fire. We're being held in a tractor beam. We're eing pulled inside, Commodore. You must veer off.
L103510 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Maintain phaser fire, helmsman.
L103511 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have lost warp power. If we don't break the tractor beam within sixty seconds, we never will.
L103512 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ But don't you understand? We've got to destroy it!
L103513 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would e proof that you are psychologically unfit for command. If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis.
L103514 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Veer off.
L103515 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Emergency impulse power.

L103518 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ We're moving away, Commodore.
L103519 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere. Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack.
L103520 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Mister Spock, status report.
L103521 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day. Repairs proceeding on transporter and communications.
L103522 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ It's sucking in space rubble from those destroyed planets. Refueling itself.
L103523 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely.
L103524 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ Then we'll have to fight it now before it gets any stronger.
L103525 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Illogical. We cannot destroy it. Therefore, we cannot save Rigel. We must transport the Captain and the others from the Constellation and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn Starfleet Command.
L103526 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Mister Spock, we've pierced the interference locally.
L103527 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Can you raise Starfleet?
L103528 +++$+++ u1118 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ No, sir, but I've got ship-to-ship communications back. Picking up Captain Kirk.

L103530 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DECKER +++$+++ I told you, I am in command here, according to every rule in the book, Captain. Anything you have to say at all, you will say to me.

L103555 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our powe eserve at a much greater rate.

L103584 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine.

L103602 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it?
L103603 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal.
L103604 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Sybo said it feeds on death.
L103605 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death. Even vegetarians.
L103606 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, but she said more than that. Not just death, but fear. She said it also feeds on fear.
L103607 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which would tend to support the proposition that the murdere was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions.
L103608 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities.
L103609 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes. Correlate hypotheses. Compare with life forms register. Question. Could such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy?
L103610 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ The Drella of Alpha Carinae Five derives nourishment from the emotion of love. There is sufficient precedent for existence of creature, nature unknown, which could exist on emotion of fear.
L103611 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity.
L103612 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity.
L103613 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field.
L103614 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature.
L103615 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified.
L103616 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doesn't seem likely, does it?
L103617 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all ut the victim to the presence of the killer.
L103618 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill.
L103619 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species.
L103620 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Working. 1932. Shanghai, China, Earth. Seven women knifed to death. 1974, Kiev, USSR, Earth. Five women knifed to death. 2105. Martian colonies. Eight women knifed to death. 2156. Heliopolis, Alpha Eridani Two. Ten women knifed to death. There are additional examples.
L103621 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth.
L103622 +++$+++ u1038 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ HENGIST +++$+++ Prefect, this has gone far enough. I will not take the stand.
L103623 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what etter position from which to kill with impunity?
L103624 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.
L103625 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold.
L103626 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon.
L103627 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A.
L103628 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Working. Exhibit A on visual. Composition of blade, boridium. Composition of handle, murinite. Details of carving on handle conform to folk art forms, indicating place of origin.
L103629 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Specify. Point of origin.
L103630 +++$+++ u1027 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VOICE  +++$+++ Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! Redjac! Redjac!
L103631 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is unquestionably controlling it.
L103632 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Scotty, give me a hand.
L103633 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked.
L103634 +++$+++ u1257 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MORLA +++$+++ You mean it could kill us all?
L103635 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills.
L103636 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me. </font></p
L103637 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control
L103638 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved?
L103639 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them.
L103640 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That ought to do it. </font></p
L103641 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Apparently our friends learned very quickly.
L103642 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Too quickly. Bridge.
L103643 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Freefall!
L103644 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That was due to be next. Life-support malfunction.
L103645 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We don't have much time, Captain.
L103646 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock.
L103647 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long. A few hours at best.
L103648 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L103649 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time.
L103650 +++$+++ u1027 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VOICE  +++$+++ I am without ending. I have existed from the dawn of time, and I shall I live beyond its end! In the meantime, I shall feed, and this time I do not need a knife. You will all die horribly in searing pain!
L103651 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is attempting to generate terror, Captain.
L103652 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ With an armful of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a supernova.
L103653 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ready.
L103654 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Implement.
L103655 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the last digit the value of pi.
L103656 +++$+++ u1027 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ VOICE  +++$+++ No, no, no, no! No, no!
L103657 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without esolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop.
L103658 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while.
L103659 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding. Bank after bank is turning to the problem.
L103660 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me.
L103661 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled.
L103662 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That thing can't die.
L103663 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless.
L103664 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, I can see that. Well Mister Spock, for the next five or six hours, we're going to have the happiest crew in space. Of course, we won't get much work done.
L103665 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity.
L103666 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They have to answer.
L103667 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life.
L103668 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people.
L103669 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I register no life readings at all, sir.
L103670 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's impossible. What could have happened?
L103671 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable adioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background adiation.
L103672 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any other possibilities?
L103673 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the outine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene lood burn does not act that swiftly.
L103674 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu.
L103675 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain.
L103676 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good.
L103677 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes.
L103678 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ninety?
L103679 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent.
L103680 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I think we can expect others, Lieutenant.
L103681 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatte our shields completely.
L103682 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, speed of those bolts.
L103683 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Approximately warp fifteen, Captain.
L103684 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing.  Source, Spock.
L103685 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range.  Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres.
L103686 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Has the target changed location, Mister Spock?
L103687 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir. Holding steady.
L103688 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Torpedo away.  Direct hit.
L103689 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo.
L103690 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock .
L103691 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They are in good working order, Captain.
L103692 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's problematical, sir.
L103693 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit.
L103694 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Miste Spock?
L103695 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape, oughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre.
L103696 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ What kind of intelligent creatures can exist in a thing that small?
L103697 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott.
L103698 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Analysis sector, channel one, main computer. Decode.
L103699 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once.
L103700 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you decode it?
L103701 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary.
L103702 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ It's mathematical. Yes, one symbol. The symbol repeat. Sir, that isn't in the Starfleet code. It's an old-style interplanetary code.
L103703 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L103704 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Repeat what? The message I sent?
L103705 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem so, Captain.
L103706 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ It's another signal now, sir.
L103707 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to communicate.
L103708 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Aye, Captain.
L103709 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out.
L103710 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out.
L103711 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nomad?
L103712 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sensor readings, Mister Spock.
L103713 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get through.
L103714 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of eference. It won't know more than it does now.
L103715 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A reasonable course.
L103716 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ In my opinion, that's a machine.
L103717 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer.
L103718 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NOMAD +++$+++ I am Nomad. What is opinion?
L103719 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment.
L103720 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s?
L103721 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the series. But if this is that probe
L103722 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, Bones, come with us. </font></p
L103723 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Chart 14A, sir?
L103724 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out fo that.
L103725 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll have the readout in a moment.
L103726 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, I
L103727 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory anks.
L103728 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me.
L103729 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe.
L103730 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago.
L103731 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ True.
L103732 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Nomad was destroyed.
L103733 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was adly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself.
L103734 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk.
L103735 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted.
L103736 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's not the same.
L103737 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The unanswered question is, the other what?  a prototype.
L103738 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms.
L103739 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic.
L103740 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CARLISLE +++$+++ Aye, sir. Acknowledge.
L103741 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room.
L103742 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NOMAD +++$+++ That unit is defective. Its thinking is chaotic. Absorbing it unsettled me.
L103743 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That unit is a woman.
L103744 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd etter give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram.
L103745 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity.
L103746 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's unbelievable.
L103747 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L103748 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy will explain it to you.
L103749 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, Doctor?
L103750 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NOMAD +++$+++ The unit Scott required simple structural repair. The knowledge anks of this unit have been wiped clean.
L103751 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage ut only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated.
L103752 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes. I'll get on it right away. Oh, and in spite of the way you epaired Scotty, you metal ticking
L103753 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?
L103754 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. Nomad, you will go with these units.  They will take you to a waiting area. Take it to the top security cell.
L103755 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form.
L103756 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's a laugh.
L103757 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The study of it would be of great use, Captain.
L103758 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's the problem?
L103759 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its co-operation, I can do nothing.
L103760 +++$+++ u1060 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NOMAD +++$+++ My screens are down.
L103761 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you.
L103762 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection.

L103774 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then it isn't Nomad?
L103775 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation.

L103783 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit. In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect.
L103784 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It was a foolish mistake.
L103785 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth.

L103802 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What?
L103803 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a emarkable instrument.
L103804 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son.

L103806 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange senso eadings. Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told.
L103807 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry would be quite efficacious.
L103808 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you sure about that?
L103809 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this. Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees.

L103811 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I find that most unusual, Captain.
L103812 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on your tricorder?
L103813 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
L103814 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's strange.

L103818 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it?

L103821 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say.
L103822 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I was about to take some readings.
L103823 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Anything?

L103825 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz.  Fragile, good cleavage. An analysis should prove interesting.
L103826 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Miste Spock?
L103827 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power.
L103828 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down here. Kirk out.
L103829 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier.
L103830 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Some kind of generator?
L103831 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean.

L103836 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Just what do you think you were trying to do?
L103837 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I
L103838 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself.
L103839 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way.
L103840 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man.
L103841 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall do so.
L103842 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you?

L103849 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable.
L103850 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I could've prevented all of it.
L103851 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't see how.

L103853 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture.
L103854 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I also have the option to disregard those orders if I conside them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute ecause I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead. And the ship's in trouble.
L103855 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do. Self-recriminations  Captain, our friend is back.

L103858 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a very high efficiency rating.
L103859 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice!
L103860 +++$+++ u1101 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ AKUTA +++$+++ Akuta alone speaks to Vaal. I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal. It is Vaal's wish.

L103862 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But this is not the centre, Mister Spock.
L103863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is an access point. It would also seem to be a
L103864 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A force field?
L103865 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously.
L103866 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You all right?
L103867 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable.

L103869 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable.

L103879 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence.
L103880 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But it needs to eat. Frequently. So it can't have any great powe eserves.
L103881 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free.

L103886 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement.
L103887 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy.
L103888 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth.
L103889 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them.
L103890 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here. These are humanoids, intelligent. They need to advance and grow. Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years. This isn't life. It's stagnation.
L103891 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What eve you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional eaction to it.
L103892 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock?

L103894 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady.
L103895 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, I believe it's safe,  safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions.
L103896 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones was right. These people aren't living, they're existing. They don't create, they don't produce, they don't even think. They exist to service a machine.
L103897 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive.
L103898 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ These are people, not robots. They should have the opportunity of choice. We owe it to them to interfere.

L104050 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Perhaps they weren't expecting us.
L104051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual check of every scientific expedition is routine.
L104052 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age.

L104055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays.
L104056 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs.

L104061 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated.

L104069 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than ou odies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time.

L104093 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold.
L104094 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor.
L104095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. As I always suspected.
L104096 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to. But we find something. </font></p
L104097 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commodore?
L104098 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Mister Spock, a starship can function with a Chief Engineer, a Chief Medical Officer, even a First Officer under physical par. But it's disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection.
L104099 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am aware of that.
L104100 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Please understand me. My admiration for Captain Kirk is unbounded. He is a great officer. But Mister Spock, I need your help and your co-operation.
L104101 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ For what, sir?
L104102 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise.
L104103 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ On what grounds, Commodore?
L104104 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is unable to perform his duties.
L104105 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction?
L104106 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Yes, but you're a Vulcan. You have a much greater life span. You show the affects to a much smaller degree.
L104107 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command.
L104108 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Well, if you are not, with your Vulcan physique, then obviously Captain Kirk cannot be.
L104109 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, I do have duties to perform.
L104110 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Mister Spock. I do not like what I'm about to say but egulations demand it. And as a Starfleet flag officer, I must follow regulations. As second in command of the Enterprise, you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing.
L104111 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I resist that suggestion, Commodore.
L104112 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ It's not a matter of choice. When a captain is unfit, physically or mentally, a competency hearing is mandatory. Please don't make me quote a regulation which you know as well as I do.
L104113 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours.
L104114 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Mister Spock, may I make a statement? I have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the Starfleet. I have tried to convince Captain Kirk of the necessity of proceeding to Starbase Ten, but I've been overruled in each case. The responsibility of this hearing is mine.
L104115 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement?
L104116 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her. Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work.
L104117 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them.
L104118 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Very kind of you, Spock.
L104119 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?
L104120 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Two years, sir.
L104121 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions?
L104122 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ No, sir.
L104123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four?
L104124 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104125 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?
L104126 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104127 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did he order you to increase orbit?
L104128 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?
L104130 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I don't have to repeat myself.
L104131 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Sulu, please answer the question.
L104132 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order.
L104133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed. Is that correct?
L104134 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ATKINS +++$+++ Sir, he had more important things on his mind.
L104135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yeoman, you will simply answer the question.
L104136 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ATKINS +++$+++ I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it.
L104137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You guess?
L104138 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ATKINS +++$+++ He'd forgot he'd signed it.
L104139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have oken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom?
L104140 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ They are.
L104141 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?
L104142 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Those of Captain Kirk.
L104143 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four?
L104144 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ He did.
L104145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Using Code two.
L104146 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three.
L104147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two.
L104148 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Yes.
L104149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy!
L104150 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, Spock? What is it?
L104151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk.
L104152 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I did.
L104153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base.
L104154 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ The computer differs with you, Captain.
L104155 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy.
L104156 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes.
L104157 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition.
L104158 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging.
L104159 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?
L104160 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now
L104161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age. Do you agree with it?
L104162 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine.
L104163 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you agree with it, Doctor?
L104164 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim.
L104165 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add.
L104166 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ No. I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock.
L104167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?
L104168 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Miste Spock.
L104169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I would suggest
L104170 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two
L104171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gamma Hydra Four, Captain.
L104172 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. A slip of the tongue.
L104173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions.
L104174 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's. Spock, I wouldn't have believed it of you. Go ahead. Ask me questions. I'll show you what I'm capable of. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Go ahead! Ask me anything! We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra Two, right? Anyhow, it doesn't matter. There's a lot more to running a starship than answering a lot of fool questions. A lot more. Go ahead. Ask me questions.
L104175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have no more questions, Captain.
L104176 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ask me anything. Anything.
L104177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the oom so the board can vote
L104178 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ Well, since the senior officers are incapable and I am of flag ank, I am forced by regulations to assume command.
L104179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, you have never commanded a starship.
L104180 +++$+++ u1215 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ STOCKER +++$+++ What would you have, a junior officer with far less experience than I have?
L104181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The danger from the Romulans
L104182 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L104183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain.
L104184 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ So, I've been relieved.
L104185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sorry, Captain.
L104186 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney.
L104187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Regulations require
L104188 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all along. First little excuse you get
L104189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I have not assumed command.
L104190 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed command?
L104191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suffer the same affliction as you, sir.
L104192 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If you're not in command, who is?
L104193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commodore Stocker.
L104194 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command.
L104195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking officer
L104196 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher. I order you to take command.
L104197 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot, Captain.
L104198 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you refusing a direct order?
L104199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship.
L104200 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old? </font></p
L104201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.
L104202 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together. We were on the surface together. The same spot. We were together all the time.
L104203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments.
L104204 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock, something happened.
L104205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember
L104206 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early esearch, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered.
L104207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed.
L104208 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. No. My ship. My ship.
L104209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements.
L104210 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ All right. Let's, let's go.
L104211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It could cure or kill, Doctor.
L104212 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll die anyway. Do it.
L104213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor Wallace, give him the shot.
L104214 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Standing by, sir.
L104215 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as you expected them to.
L104216 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating?
L104217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104218 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now.
L104219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling ehind.
L104220 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're eady, Mister Spock.
L104221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am quite ready now, Doctor.
L104222 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay.
L104223 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is very considerate of you, Doctor.
L104224 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Good morning, sir, Doctor.
L104225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Something wrong?
L104226 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes. There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite pinpoint it.
L104227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has only been aboard seventy two hours.
L104228 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't.
L104229 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments.
L104230 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles, whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who won't talk about his background.
L104231 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I see.
L104232 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all the difference.
L104233 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.
L104234 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam without reason.
L104235 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles.
L104236 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any sign of the intruder? </font></p
L104237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting.
L104238 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L104239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is, we could extinguish ourselves.
L104240 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ An android.
L104241 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And most sophisticated.
L104242 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I am not programmed to respond in that area.
L104243 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He simply appears to have turned himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship
L104244 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Sorry. That'd be against the law. My law. Decreed by Mudd the First. Voted in by the resident population. Lovely, aren't they? You must admit, Kirk, that I still retain my eye for beauty. I decreed that I should always be surrounded by it, and my decrees always come to pass. I've had five hundred of them made up to attend me. All of them identical, beautiful, compliant, obedient.
L104245 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.
L104246 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free enterprise system, I found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict as a matter of principle.
L104247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He did not pay royalties.
L104248 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Worse than that. Do know what the penalty for fraud is on Dene Five?
L104249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death y gas, death by phaser, death by hanging.
L104250 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ They've no respect for private property. They damaged the bloody spaceship. Well, I got away, but I couldn't navigate, so I wandered out through unmapped space, and here I found Mudd.
L104251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive.
L104252 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Yes, well, right, laddybuck. So here I am in a planet with ove two hundred thousand hard-working, happy androids, all of whom exist merely to serve my every whim. It's absolute paradise.
L104253 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then I'm unable to discern your problem.
L104254 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No, Captain. They died over the stretch of time.

L104256 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble.
L104257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently. There must be a central control system which guides the entire android population.
L104258 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I trust you are enjoying yourself, Mister Spock.
L104259 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual device.
L104260 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It is our central control complex.
L104261 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you?
L104262 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Two hundred and seven thousand, eight hundred and nine.
L104263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you controlled through this device?
L104264 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I am not programmed to respond in this area.
L104265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oh, that's quite understandable. </font></p
L104266 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Alice.
L104267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd. Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited quantity.
L104268 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALICE 471 +++$+++ Please explain unhappy.
L104269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled.
L104270 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Interesting.
L104271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L104272 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to have free run of the galaxy.
L104273 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them?
L104274 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We shall take care of them.
L104275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Eminently practical.
L104276 +++$+++ u1091 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yes, Captain. And we shall serve them and you will be happy, and controlled. </font></p humans in the galaxy is not very funny.
L104277 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it.
L104278 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Take my word for it, they can.
L104279 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and they'll be able to leave orbit.
L104280 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ How do you know so much?
L104281 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I asked them.
L104282 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Well, Captain, androids and robots, they're just not capable of independent, creative thought.
L104283 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them.
L104284 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I agree. What in your opinion does direct them?
L104285 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies, Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Osca series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman.
L104286 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Norman. When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate. Why Norman? Unless
L104287 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To function as they do, each android mind must be one component of a mass brain linked through a central locus.
L104288 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation.
L104289 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would seem logical.
L104290 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Captain, you sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen, but what the devil are you talking about?
L104291 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity.
L104292 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Opportunity? Now, listen, Spock, you may be a wonderful science officer, but believe me, you couldn't sell fake patents to your mother.
L104293 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents.
L104294 +++$+++ u1031 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALICE 27 +++$+++ Mister Spock, you have a remarkably logical and analytical mind.
L104295 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you.
L104296 +++$+++ u1253 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALICE 210 +++$+++ Is there some significance to this action?
L104297 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I love you. However, I hate you.
L104298 +++$+++ u1253 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALICE 210 +++$+++ But I'm identical in every way with Alice Twenty Seven.
L104299 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical.
L104300 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical.
L104301 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. </font></p
L104302 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well?
L104303 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root.
L104304 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what we've done. If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them. Does everybody remember what to do?
L104305 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L104306 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why not?
L104307 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad. Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are green.
L104308 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage. Miste Spock, it is time. The explosive.
L104309 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, Captain.
L104310 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Don't panic. Women and children first.
L104311 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are you ready?
L104312 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MUDD +++$+++ Aye, aye!
L104313 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Be careful. I would not want you to drop it.
L104314 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I am not programmed to respond in that area.
L104315 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe they are all immobilised, Captain.
L104316 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock.
L104317 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy?
L104318 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours. Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic. And we poor, irrational humans whipped them in a fair fight. Now you'll find yourself back among us illogical humans again.
L104319 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans.
L104320 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet.
L104321 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.
L104322 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ One parsec, sir. Close enough to smell them.
L104323 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is illogical, Ensign. Odours cannot travel through the vacuum of space.
L104324 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I was making a little joke, sir.
L104325 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Extremely little, Ensign.
L104326 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant?
L104327 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The attle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years ago. Inconclusive.
L104328 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Analysis of disputed area?
L104329 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, ou Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim.
L104330 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Burke, sir? I don't think so. I'm sure it was
L104331 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ John Burke was the Chief Astronomer at the Royal Academy in old Britain at the time.
L104332 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BARIS +++$+++ Quadrotriticale is not wheat, Captain. Of course, I wouldn't expect you or Mister Spock to know about such things, but quadrotriticale is a rather
L104333 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of wheat and rye. A perennial, also, I believe. Its root grain, triticale, can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century Canada
L104334 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BARIS +++$+++ What do you mean?
L104335 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence.
L104336 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LURRY +++$+++ Captain, couldn't you at least post a couple of guards? We do have a large number of ships passing through.
L104337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation.
L104338 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Summoning a starship on a priority A-1 channel to guard some storage compartments. Storage compartments of wheat.
L104339 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us successfully develop Sherman's Planet.
L104340 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Now, that's just lovely.
L104341 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But not totally unexpected.
L104342 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104343 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A most curious creature, Captain. Its trilling seems to have a tranquillising effect on the human nervous system. Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect.  down. Spock and Kirk leave.)

L104345 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, may I ask where you'll be?
L104346 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What's the matter, Spock?
L104347 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's something disquieting about these creatures.
L104348 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Don't tell me you've got a feeling.
L104349 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a great deal. I see no practical use for them.
L104350 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound.
L104351 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one.
L104352 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way.
L104353 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with practically anything.
L104354 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet, ut there's one thing that I have discovered.
L104355 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What is that, Doctor?
L104356 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I like them better than I like you.
L104357 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor?
L104358 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes?
L104359 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They do have one redeeming characteristic.
L104360 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What's that?
L104361 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir. tribble. Then he notices that there are fluffy balls everywhere.)
L104362 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will. And, brother, have they got a lot of will.
L104363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning nothing.
L104364 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh, really?
L104365 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no estraining factors.
L104366 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Of course. What did you say?
L104367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape.
L104368 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I heard you.
L104369 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He simply could not believe his ears.
L104370 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BARIS +++$+++ The man is an independent scout, Captain. It is quite possible he is also a Klingon spy.
L104371 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's neve oken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles.

L104375 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station.
L104376 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Here. Let me try it.  instead. That does open, and a whole load of tribbles fall out, burying the gallant Captain up to his shoulders. Spock examines one.)
L104377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They seem to be gorged.
L104378 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hundreds of thousands.
L104379 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a period of three days.
L104380 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's assuming they got here three days ago.
L104381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment.
L104382 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Now he tells me.
L104383 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these.
L104384 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't e for long.
L104385 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain.
L104386 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BARIS +++$+++ No, Kirk. You can't let him. That will give them the wedge they need to claim Sherman's Planet.
L104387 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris.
L104388 +++$+++ u1033 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KOLOTH +++$+++ Can you get those things out of here?  Darvin enters, and the tribbles shriek.)
L104389 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Remarkable.
L104390 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons.  But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you.
L104391 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain.
L104392 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Captain, one little tribble isn't harmful. Captain, you wouldn't do a thing like that to me, now would you? Would you?
L104393 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.
L104394 +++$+++ u1144 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ It would take years.
L104395 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Seventeen point nine, to be exact.
L104396 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You'll do it?
L104397 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He'll do it.
L104398 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course. Spock.
L104399 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the possibilities of

L104401 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering.
L104402 +++$+++ u1047 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ Original Airdate +++$+++ 15 Mar, 1968
L104403 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the survey vessel SS Beagle.
L104404 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Missing for six years, and now this junk in space.
L104405 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings. Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever.
L104406 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years?
L104407 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead.
L104408 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Standard orbit around the planet. There may be survivors there.
L104409 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty seven, commanded by. Jim, I believe you knew him. Captain R M Merik.
L104410 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however.
L104411 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diamete seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth.
L104412 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Exactly in some ways, different in others.
L104413 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I also picked up indications of large cities.
L104414 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What era?
L104415 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system.
L104416 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Captain, both amplitude and frequency modulation being used. I think I can pick up something visual. It's a news broadcast using a system I think they once called video.
L104417 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Television was the colloquial term.
L104418 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Slaves and gladiators. What are we seeing, a twentieth-century Rome?

L104445 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your first citizen?
L104446 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEPTIMUS +++$+++ First I must discuss it with the others.
L104447 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy?
L104448 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Odd that these people should worship the sun.
L104449 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why, Doctor?
L104450 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLAVIUS +++$+++ Long ago there were rebellions, but they were suppressed. And with each century, the slaves acquired more rights under the law. They eceived rights to medicine, the right to government payments in thei old age, and they slowly learned to be content.
L104451 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions.
L104452 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock. Just as it's logical that twentieth-century Rome would use television to show its gladiato contests or name a new car the Jupiter Eight.
L104453 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me.
L104454 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Miste Spock.
L104455 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error.
L104456 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MERIK +++$+++ There's been no war here for over four hundred years, Jim. Could, let's say, your land of that same era make that same boast? I think you can see why they don't want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places.
L104457 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable.
L104458 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Are you out of your head?
L104459 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating.
L104460 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history.
L104461 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor.
L104462 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism.
L104463 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in you first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on?

L104473 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door.
L104474 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had ou disagreements. Maybe they're jokes. I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is
L104475 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be ief?
L104476 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena.
L104477 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, that's quite true.
L104478 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin!
L104479 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a eduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore
L104480 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living. Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out. That's it, isn't it? Insecurity. Why, you wouldn't know what to do with a genuine, warm, decent feeling.
L104481 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Really, Doctor?
L104482 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What happened, Jim?
L104483 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What did they do to you?
L104484 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed. I am sorry. I liked that huge sun worshiper.
L104485 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely. It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total otherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion.
L104486 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood.

L104498 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ I gave Spock his first instruction in computers, Captain. He chose to devote his knowledge to Starfleet instead of the Vulcan Science Academy.

L104506 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Care to guess what she is?
L104507 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate.

L104509 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten.
L104510 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Who aboard would have that knowledge?
L104511 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times.
L104512 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father.
L104513 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, Captain? Interesting.
L104514 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect?
L104515 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcans do not approve of violence.
L104516 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're saying he couldn't have done it?
L104517 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason.
L104518 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But if he had a reason, could he have done it?
L104519 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing. Logically and efficiently.
L104520 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Captain, you're not accusing him?
L104521 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect.
L104522 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I don't know that yet either.
L104523 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull.
L104524 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm sorry about your father.
L104525 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, it could adversely affect our mission.
L104526 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Aren't you worried about him?
L104527 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened. The ship's hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes. It is manned, but sensors cannot make out specifics.
L104528 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons?
L104529 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
L104530 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel?
L104531 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission.
L104532 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why not?
L104533 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No standard references apply.
L104534 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are any conclusions possible from the information?
L104535 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien.
L104536 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ None.
L104537 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?
L104538 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.
L104539 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach.
L104540 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, I'd say that's rare.
L104541 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My blood is T-negative, Doctor.
L104542 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ We've run a number of blood tests on Mister Spock. It isn't true Vulcan blood either. It has human blood elements in it.
L104543 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
L104544 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood.
L104545 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. I would estimate the odds
L104546 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian.
L104547 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
L104548 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental.
L104549 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But it does look promising.
L104550 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level.
L104551 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable.
L104552 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of lood in the body. It's only experimental.
L104553 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five.
L104554 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him.
L104555 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would you pull those records, please?
L104556 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to your father.
L104557 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem the only answer.
L104558 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ And I refuse to permit it. I won't risk both of you.
L104559 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will die.

L104585 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be.

I watched you, knowing that inside that the human part of you was crying and I cried, too. There must be some part of me in you, some part that I still can reach.

L104595 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I must see the captain.

L104604 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan.
L104605 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us. That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they neve intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier.

L104610 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SAREK +++$+++ She has always been that way.
L104611 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed? Why did you marry her?
L104612 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two.

L104651 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life.
L104652 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there?
L104653 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors.
L104654 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them out there, wherever they are.
L104655 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation.
L104656 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock.
L104657 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination.
L104658 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's been nearly an hour. Can people live that long as disassembled atoms in a transporter beam?
L104659 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a fascinating project.
L104660 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive.
L104661 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely.
L104662 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The odds are not good.
L104663 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. I would say approximately four hundred

L104665 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look.

L104668 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What would account for that, Spock?
L104669 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor. And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it.
L104670 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Well, the transporter has neither the power nor the range to account for that.

L104690 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two. Now you've dragged us a dozen light years on some wild hunch that
L104691 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching. No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that clarify the situation?
L104692 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Doctor McCoy speaks for me, too, sir.

L104695 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?
L104696 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I would be more than content to do so, sir, and maybe a wee bit more.

L104742 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He froze. One man was killed. Another may die.
L104743 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, scientifically
L104744 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Miste Spock. It's a relief.
L104745 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I need your advice.
L104746 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Then I need a drink.
L104747 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not understand your reasoning.
L104748 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You need advice from me? You must be kidding.
L104749 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I equire an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea.
L104750 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim and his creature?
L104751 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut?
L104752 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance to scan the tapes. There are eight or ten hours of record tape there.
L104753 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was Garrovick.
L104754 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The same as our Ensign.
L104755 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I suggest you study this.
L104756 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated?
L104757 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Ou eply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent ehaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We espectfully ask permission to inquire further
L104758 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions.
L104759 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It carries perishable drugs
L104760 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut eleven years ago.
L104761 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Creature, Captain?
L104762 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I could sense it thinking, planning.
L104763 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it communicate with you?
L104764 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here?
L104765 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel, it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets.
L104766 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV  +++$+++ Point zero four light years ahead. Our phasers won't reach it, sir.
L104767 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it for days.
L104768 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, how do you read that?
L104769 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state etween matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion.
L104770 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock?
L104771 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter.
L104772 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Deflectors up, sir.
L104773 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The deflectors will not stop it, Captain.
L104774 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's impossible.
L104775 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity.
L104776 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang you trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it.
L104777 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whethe or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been endered academic. The creature is now after us.
L104778 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Creature, Mister Spock?
L104779 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered and intelligent.
L104780 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us. Instead it chose to turn and attack here. Why?
L104781 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of the creature.
L104782 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong.
L104783 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phase hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault.
L104784 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My concern is with the ship and the crew. </font></p
L104785 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed y what you consider to be a failure on your part?  I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species. When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will experience a split second of indecision. He hesitates. Do I have your attention, Ensign?
L104786 +++$+++ u1151 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GARROVICK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104787 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than
L104788 +++$+++ u1151 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GARROVICK +++$+++ Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here
L104789 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio.  Do you smell something?
L104790 +++$+++ u1151 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GARROVICK +++$+++ Sir, it's coming through the vent.
L104791 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off.  to the vent, but the damaged switch breaks off in his hand.)
L104792 +++$+++ u1151 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GARROVICK +++$+++ He saved my life, Captain. I should be lying dead in there, not him.
L104793 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure worked. The vent is closed.
L104794 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's that green blood of his.
L104795 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron.
L104796 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too.
L104797 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct.
L104798 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now.
L104799 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you believe you're in communication with the creature?
L104800 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Direction, Mister Spock.
L104801 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now.
L104802 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can deliver. Keep at it until we begin to shake apart. Kirk out. I believe I know where it's going.
L104803 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would dictate that
L104804 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of that system. That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut eleven years ago.
L104805 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not understand, Captain.
L104806 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was somehow different. Something in my mind said home.
L104807 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And you know where home is, Captain?
L104808 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it.
L104809 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely.
L104810 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable.
L104811 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands.
L104812 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Antimatter seems our only possibility.
L104813 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field.
L104814 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood cells. What better bait could we have?
L104815 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is still one problem, Captain.
L104816 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The blast, yes.
L104817 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves
L104818 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock.
L104819 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate unde those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him.
L104820 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.
L104821 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical fo me to be the one
L104822 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan.
L104823 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.
L104824 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk to Enterprise.
L104825 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock here, Captain.
L104826 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.
L104827 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Acknowledged.
L104828 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Consider yourself on report. This is no time for heroics. I have no intention of sacrificing myself, at least not yet.  Spock? Spock?
L104829 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock here.
L104830 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stand by, Enterprise.  Now! Energise and detonate!
L104831 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Reset. Energise.
L104832 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Do something.
L104833 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A.
L104834 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Got them. A piece of them, anyway.
L104835 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Cross-circuiting to B.
L104836 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Captain, thank heaven.
L104837 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them.
L104838 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Captain. There was a message from Starbase Six. Heavy interference. All I get is Intrepid and what sounded like a secto co-ordinate.
L104839 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
L104840 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What is it, Spock? Are you in pain?
L104841 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred Vulcans aboard, all dead.
L104842 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay.
L104843 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I know what I know.
L104844 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Get to the Sickbay.
L104845 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L104846 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, no, no. That's an order.
L104847 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L104848 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ It is dead.
L104849 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was momentary. It passed quickly.
L104850 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed?
L104851 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I sensed it die.
L104852 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject efore
L104853 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us.
L104854 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.
L104855 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known.
L104856 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ But four hundred Vulcans?
L104857 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easie to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours.
L104858 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you?
L104859 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody. </font></p solar system. Any update from Starfleet?

L104861 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've never encountered readings like this before.
L104862 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?
L104863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would assume that.
L104864 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud.
L104865 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not very likely, Ensign.
L104866 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock.
L104867 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A system.
L104868 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Speculation, Spock.
L104869 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have none, Captain. Insufficient data.
L104870 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have none, Captain. Insufficient data.

L104872 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead.
L104873 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No analysis due to insufficient information.
L104874 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it. Insufficient data is not sufficient, Mister Spock. You're the science officer. You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time.
L104875 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant.
L104876 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what it is, let's use reverse logic. Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what it isn't.
L104877 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it.
L104878 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ So far that's not much help.
L104879 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since ou deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify.
L104880 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the Intrepid?
L104881 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very possible.
L104882 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir.

L104898 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you have any ideas, Spock?
L104899 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker.

L104905 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced. Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the Intrepid.
L104906 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The same thing, not the zone itself?
L104907 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain.
L104908 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, Captain, but I'll reserve some for the shields in case we don't get out.
L104909 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would e extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time.
L104910 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty. Report to your stations, continue your research. Dismissed.
L104911 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed.
L104912 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just pointed out how illogical this situation is.
L104913 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them. Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed.

L104915 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it.
L104916 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What was it you sensed?
L104917 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The touch of death.
L104918 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And what do you think they felt?

L104923 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain.

L104925 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Probe will impact in seven point three seconds.
L104926 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Yes, sir. Data being relayed to Mister Spock.
L104927 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles.

L104929 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death. </font></p
L104930 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life. In fact it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at now. But that thing can apparently perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism. It can reproduce, it can breathe, it can eat, although I don't know what.
L104931 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus.
L104932 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we survived?
L104933 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did.
L104934 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed.
L104935 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it.
L104936 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's a suicide mission.
L104937 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction.
L104938 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots.
L104939 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you.

L104941 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Vulcans saw it first and died.
L104942 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Just because the Vulcans failed
L104943 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am more capable.
L104944 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.
L104945 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist.

L104985 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please?

L104988 +++$+++ u1148 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KALO +++$+++ Yeah? We ain't playing for peanuts. What's the matter, you guys never saw a hit before?
L104989 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask.
L104990 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OXMYX +++$+++ Yeah, sure. Maybe a dozen or so, not counting the small fry, but then they get burned anyway soon as I get around to it.
L104991 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako?
L104992 +++$+++ u1148 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KALO +++$+++ I'll take care of it.
L104993 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd you get this?
L104994 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OXMYX +++$+++ The Book. They left it, the other ship. The Horizon.
L104995 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire culture based on this.
L104996 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OXMYX +++$+++ What aggression? I got to make hits. I want you to help me hit them. That's all.
L104997 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating, but quite impossible.
L104998 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing.
L104999 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society.
L105000 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all.
L105001 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy.
L105002 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution?
L105003 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it.
L105004 +++$+++ u1148 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KALO +++$+++ Listen, Kirk, I can play anything you can figure out. Take the cards, big man. Show us how it's played.
L105005 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't games
L105006 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin?
L105007 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have never computed them, Captain.
L105008 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts. Cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship.
L105009 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Surely, you're coming, Captain.
L105010 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You do that very well. Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment?
L105011 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer.

L105016 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KRAKO +++$+++ That's too bad. Put him on ice! with nice old valves and stuff inside. Kirk starts taking it apart.)
L105017 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion.
L105018 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You mean you're giving up?
L105019 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma.
L105020 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Mister Spock, Mister Oxmyx is making contact from the surface.

L105022 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OXMYX  +++$+++ Huh? Hey, how'd you get back up there?

L105031 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You'll show no further hostility? </font></p

L105033 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, Doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous. We are therefore forced to trust Mister Oxmyx.
L105034 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Now you're beginning to make sense.
L105035 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared. Energise.
L105036 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OXMYX +++$+++ Just the same, you be careful. They'll have heaters on them.  Now you watch this.  criminal boss of a society patterned after old Earth gangsters.
L105037 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce.

L105041 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. We agree.
L105042 +++$+++ u1159 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OXMYX +++$+++ Yeah, but I got to be the unity.
L105043 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result

L105045 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We did, Captain. The situation required our return.
L105046 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the computer?
L105047 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here.
L105048 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You admit that?
L105049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor.
L105050 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then you don't mind if I play a hunch?
L105051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical alternative.

L105067 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous.
L105068 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ A piece of the action.
L105069 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You do not even know what the action is going to be.
L105070 +++$+++ u1149 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I figure it's got to be a thick percentage or you wouldn't be trying to hit Krako.
L105071 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logical.
L105072 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KRAKO +++$+++ I ain't, pally. Put down your heaters.
L105073 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says. I just heard the sound of
L105074 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal? Forget it. That's peanuts to an outfit like the Federation. Right?
L105075 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unquestionably.
L105076 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Right?
L105077 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Right.
L105078 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action.
L105079 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A miniscule. A very small piece.
L105080 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check?
L105081 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Right.
L105082 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Right?
L105083 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Check.
L105084 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Er. Aye.
L105085 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Must we?
L105086 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's faster than walking.

L105088 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you afraid of cars?
L105089 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me.
L105090 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yeah.
L105091 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx. the pool table.)
L105092 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of you drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate.
L105093 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Brooding, Captain?
L105094 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it?
L105095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have eservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians.
L105096 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge.
L105097 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut.
L105098 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ In Bela's office?
L105099 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart
L105100 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtato works.
L105101 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have.
L105102 +++$+++ u1047 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ Original Airdate +++$+++ 23 Feb, 1968
L105103 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan.
L105104 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No sign of the spaceship. No sign of debris.
L105105 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in a shuttle craft.
L105106 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Captain, I'm getting a reading now. Two human forms at earing three hundred mark seven.
L105107 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Confirmed.  party.)
L105108 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's all right.
L105109 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting. A neural field?
L105110 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ It is our home.
L105111 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What brings you here?
L105112 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ We managed to break through it with great difficulty. Our ship was destroyed. We barely managed to escape in a lifecraft. And now we have the means to begin our journey back to Andromeda.
L105113 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy?
L105114 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ At least we'll be away from all of this openness. This is too strange for us, Hanar. We are creatures of outer space, and soon we will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls. </font></p
L105115 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecula structure.
L105116 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ They registered as human.
L105117 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook esponses. Most curious.
L105118 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy?
L105119 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The chances are very much against it.
L105120 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance.
L105121 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like.
L105122 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field.
L105123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possible. I would have to have one to examine.
L105124 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe.
L105125 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped.
L105126 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do you think you can do it again?
L105127 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall attempt it.  he is suddenly thrown across the cell. They go to his aid, Kelinda enters and Kirk grabs her and knocks her out. He takes the belt device.)
L105128 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you all right?
L105129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. </font></p ack.)
L105130 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Bring them to me. This is the essence of what they were. The flesh and brain and what you call the personality, distilled down into these compact shapes. And once crushed  this person is dead. However, that one can be restored.  Hanar?  the ship for intergalactic travel. I can't forget the picture of Yeoman Thompson crushed to a handful of dust. </font></p
L105131 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, quite all right, Doctor.
L105132 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch.
L105133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before.
L105134 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What was it?
L105135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and lurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which esemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each lim is capable of performing a different function.
L105136 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are?
L105137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Undoubtedly.
L105138 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector?
L105139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The polarized elements would burn out quickly.
L105140 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is there a chance at all?
L105141 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A small one.
L105142 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick.
L105143 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health.
L105144 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body.
L105145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation.
L105146 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour?
L105147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It will take me a moment to prepare.
L105148 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Yes, I was informed. You may go. </font></p
L105149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in Engineering.
L105150 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ This is it. Now all we have to do
L105151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible.
L105152 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Why?
L105153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine.
L105154 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's it, then.
L105155 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative energy.
L105156 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I see what you're getting at. I can't say I like it.
L105157 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain. </font></p
L105158 +++$+++ u1012 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DREA  +++$+++ Captain Kirk to the bridge, please. </font></p
L105159 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us.
L105160 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What alternative?
L105161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.
L105162 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What?
L105163 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans will be stopped here.
L105164 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Take your places, gentlemen. We're approaching the barrier.  arrier approaches, Scott's finger is poised over a flashing button.) the edge of our galaxy. Spock and Scotty have devised a suicide plan to stop the Kelvans. They have rigged the ship to explode on my signal. </font></p
L105165 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative.  All instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the arrier.&nbsp;
L105166 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ We made it.
L105167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Instruments returning to normal, Captain.
L105168 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Several systems out, sir. Operating on emergency backup. None affect flight procedure.
L105169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Life support systems sustaining on emergency.
L105170 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Do you not agree that this is better thing for them than exploding the ship as your engineer had thought to do? We detected it, of course. Tomar has devised a mechanism to prevent any furthe tampering. Please accept your situation, Captain. It will make things much less painful. </font></p
L105171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we fou are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential.
L105172 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Then how will we stop the Kelvans?
L105173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain?
L105174 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm delighted.
L105175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most curious.
L105176 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is?
L105177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions.
L105178 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food.
L105179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction.
L105180 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet. If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from thei elts.
L105181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That seems reasonable.
L105182 +++$+++ u1006 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ TOMAR +++$+++ Anything. </font></p
L105183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable, ut an interesting psychological study.&nbsp;
L105184 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise.
L105185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other.
L105186 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk.
L105187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident?
L105188 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Why should I be disturbed?
L105189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are. Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually indicate jealousy.
L105190 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ I have no reason for such a reaction. Kelinda's a female, nothing more.
L105191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.
L105192 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Well, of course she is!
L105193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You are not jealous?
L105194 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ No!
L105195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nor upset?
L105196 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Certainly not.
L105197 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Checkmate. </font></p
L105198 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should have him climbing the walls.
L105199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy.
L105200 +++$+++ u1179 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KELINDA +++$+++ I would like to speak with you, Captain.
L105201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline.
L105202 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Hmm?
L105203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Stokaline.
L105204 +++$+++ u1179 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KELINDA +++$+++ I need some more experiments.
L105205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments.
L105206 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Very well. Proceed. Have you seen Captain Kirk?
L105207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge.
L105208 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ No. I was wondering where he was.
L105209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I left him in the recreation room.
L105210 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ He was alone then.
L105211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him.
L105212 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ I told her to stay away from him.
L105213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. O perhaps Captain Kirk has more.
L105214 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. But we would welcome friends.
L105215 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own.
L105216 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ROJAN +++$+++ Perhaps. Perhaps it could be done.
L105217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal.
L105218 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well?
L105219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention.
L105220 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Someone or something has succeeded. Our distress signal relays have been activated. We've been given a direction to follow, but how? What's causing it?
L105221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain. We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has eve explored.
L105222 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Planet dead ahead, Captain. Becoming visual.
L105223 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Class M planet, Captain.
L105224 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Close to Earth conditions.
L105225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind.
L105226 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Over three weeks at this distance, sir.
L105227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L105228 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Got something?
L105229 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet.
L105230 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SARGON  +++$+++ Your probes have touched me, Mister Spock.
L105231 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms.

L105234 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SARGON  +++$+++ I will make it possible for your transporter to beam you that deep beneath the surface. Have no fear.

L105237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago.
L105238 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us.
L105239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L105240 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I see. Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock?
L105241 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently, Captain.
L105242 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Inside solid rock?
L105243 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber.
L105244 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ Strange, I'm not sure. Well, I'm not a liar, Captain. I did eceive an order to report here for duty.

L105246 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Let's get back to this solid rock business. Just how much rock are we going to go through?
L105247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor.
L105248 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ Atmosphere report, Captain. A fraction richer in oxygen than usual for us, but otherwise normal.
L105249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago. About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our senso eadings are accurate.

L105256 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ Our beliefs and our studies indicate that life on our planet, Earth, evolved independently.

L105259 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Just a moment, Doctor.
L105260 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I won't go along with this. Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are.
L105261 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with you phaser? That is still Jim's body.
L105262 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Lungs filled with air again. To see again. Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again. A half a million years. To be again. Your captain has an excellent body, Doctor McCoy. I compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it.
L105263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish?
L105264 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Have no fear. Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do.
L105265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor?
L105266 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ He'll die if you don't leave his body. Soon!
L105267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What is it you want of us?
L105268 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait. Two others still survive. Henoch and Thalassa. Thalassa, my Thalassa. I am pleased you survived with me. Forgive me. It has been so very long.
L105269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ When the struggle came which devastated your planet
L105270 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Only the best minds were chosen to survive. Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed. Henoch, from the other side. Realising ou mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides. We built this chambe here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion.
L105271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L105272 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take oot, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here.
L105273 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there KIRK: and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing. And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here.
L105274 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been eached.
L105275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose?
L105276 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ To build. To build humanoid robots. We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers.
L105277 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us.
L105278 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Is it you, Jim?  Good, his metabolic rate is back to normal.
L105279 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of it?
L105280 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ I'm not so certain of that, Doctor. It is scientifically fascinating.
L105281 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years.
L105282 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Ach! You're joking.
L105283 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, he's not.
L105284 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Metabolic rate is double and rising, Doctor.
L105285 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Hello. Oh, you are a lovely female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years.
L105286 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Thank you.
L105287 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You're welcome.
L105288 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kiss.
L105289 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the est of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above you human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race.
L105290 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch.
L105291 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor.
L105292 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too.
L105293 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism.
L105294 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A what?
L105295 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'll prepare the formula, Sargon.
L105296 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Henoch, your condition?
L105297 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I can continue in this body for several hours.
L105298 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Fortunate. We will vacate at once.
L105299 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This woman will assist me.  You will take me to you pharmacology laboratory.
L105300 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ I understand.
L105301 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will code mark for me.
L105302 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L105303 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body.
L105304 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ This hypo does not contain the same formula.
L105305 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice.
L105306 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Without the same formula, Captain Kirk will die.
L105307 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What were you saying?
L105308 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ I. I was. I wanted to say something. I've forgotten what it was.
L105309 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos.
L105310 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Yes, that, that was it. I will inform Doctor McCoy that each is properly filled for each patient.
L105311 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this ody. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that Sargon will die with him. Spock, and Doctor Ann Mulhall. </font></p can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding.
L105312 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I think it best not to remember so well.
L105313 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course. Hands without feeling. Enjoy the taste of life while you can.
L105314 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I tell you, lady, this thing won't work.
L105315 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it.

L105317 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll uild another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for anothe thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to a better way. With these bodies.
L105318 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ They're not ours, Henoch.
L105319 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this?
L105320 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ Why pretend to work on that thing, Henoch? You know you neve intended to leave Spock's body.
L105321 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman.  It is ready, Thalassa.
L105322 +++$+++ u1020 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MULHALL +++$+++ No!
L105323 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately.
L105324 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans. Spock's consciousness is gone. We must kill his body, the thing in it.
L105325 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Must I make an example of you, too, Helm?
L105326 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Must I make an example of you, too, Helm?

L105335 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness.
L105336 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But your vessel was destroyed, too. Where was your consciousness kept?
L105337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain.

L105340 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't know, Bones. We're here to find out what's happened ecause I don't know.
L105341 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared.
L105342 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy.
L105343 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events.
L105344 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ From Ekos?
L105345 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have.
L105346 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Nothing, sir.
L105347 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead.
L105348 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Fire.  mind.)
L105349 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead.
L105350 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Maybe they had help. Maximum orbit. Take us out of range of thei detection range.
L105351 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon.
L105352 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ He must be dead. And what's going on down there on Ekos?
L105353 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful.
L105354 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You ready?
L105355 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ready, Captain.
L105356 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Energise.
L105357 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in architecture. Interesting.

L105360 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Unbelievable. Do you recognise those uniforms?
L105361 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi Germany.  in the street.)
L105362 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim.
L105363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear.
L105364 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's John Gill. The Fuhrer?
L105365 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L105366 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, take his uniform.
L105367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain?
L105368 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach.
L105369 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's very well taken, Captain. </font></p
L105370 +++$+++ u1189 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Lieutenant, what have we here? A Zeon?
L105371 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland?
L105372 +++$+++ u1189 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ With all Zeon pigs, Lieutenant.
L105373 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Take charge of him.
L105374 +++$+++ u1189 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ With pleasure. Today we have a surprise planned for you, Zeon.
L105375 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your uniform, Captain.
L105376 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I elieve.
L105377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. </font></p
L105378 +++$+++ u1180 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Lieutenant? Better see a doctor. You don't look well. You colour.
L105379 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. I shall tend to it, Major.
L105380 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ENEG +++$+++ I've had a full report. You are not from Zeon.
L105381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously.
L105382 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ Why did they take you? You're not a Zeon. He certainly is not one.
L105383 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why do the Nazis hate Zeons?
L105384 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ Why? Because without us to hate, there'd be nothing to hold them together. So the Party has built us into a threat, a disease to be wiped out.
L105385 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is Zeon a threat to them?
L105386 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ Where did you come from? Our warlike period ended dozens of generations ago. We came here. We thought we were civilising the Ekosians.
L105387 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem the assumption was premature.
L105388 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ Warlike, yes, but not vicious. That started when the Nazi movement began only a few years ago.
L105389 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival.
L105390 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We must get our communicators, contact the ship.
L105391 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard eyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy.

L105393 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes.
L105394 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock.

L105396 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the figures computed?
L105397 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres.
L105398 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres.
L105399 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately, there. That is, of course, a crude estimation.
L105400 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low.
L105401 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform.
L105402 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I would be honoured, Mister Spock.
L105403 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals.  against the well-injured back.)
L105404 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back. I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry.
L105405 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course e very crude.
L105406 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just hurry, please.
L105407 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, why should I aim at such a structure?
L105408 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ Take me with you. Give me a chance to fight them.
L105409 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I remind you, we did not intend to fight.
L105410 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Here they are. The communicators, disassembled. Can you get one to work?
L105411 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possibly.
L105412 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ Who are you people?
L105413 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not see them.
L105414 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We came for John Gill.
L105415 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet.
L105416 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ If we adopt the ways of the Nazis, we're as bad as the Nazis.
L105417 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere?
L105418 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ABROM +++$+++ This way.
L105419 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test it, except in actual use.
L105420 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The girl on the viewscreen.
L105421 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The one receiving a medal.
L105422 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient. We must be very, very careful in order to survive here. We of the Underground don't know who our leaders are. That way, if we break under pressure, we can only etray a handful of our people.
L105423 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw he eing decorated.
L105424 +++$+++ u1220 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DARAS +++$+++ You mean that the Fuhrer is an alien?
L105425 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is correct.
L105426 +++$+++ u1220 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DARAS +++$+++ Of course. As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the Fatherland.
L105427 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards.
L105428 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Smile, gentlemen. There will be more coverage later. Thank you very much. Let's get a moving shot down the hall.
L105429 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked up.
L105430 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment.
L105431 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Or a deep psychosis.
L105432 +++$+++ u1219 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ISAK +++$+++ The cloakroom? </font></p
L105433 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It may not have the range it had. In fact, it may not work at all.
L105434 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Think positively, Spock.
L105435 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise.
L105436 +++$+++ u1220 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DARAS +++$+++ Isak just heard two security men. They picked up your broadcast, pin-pointed it within this building. They're starting to search.
L105437 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our
L105438 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements. The right oot's too tight.
L105439 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push. We have no time for emotionalism.
L105440 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, he thought he would embarrass the Fuhrer.
L105441 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. A doctor should have more pride.
L105442 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Hail the Fuhrer.
L105443 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us.
L105444 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mister Spock.
L105445 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ True. I shall reconsider.
L105446 +++$+++ u1249 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ If we fulfill our own greatness, that will all be ended. Working together
L105447 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern.
L105448 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Definitely drugged, almost comatose.
L105449 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What drug?
L105450 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos?
L105451 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions.
L105452 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well done, Spock. They've kept what's left of him as a figure head.
L105453 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon.
L105454 +++$+++ u1249 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Most efficient state Earth ever knew.
L105455 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination.
L105456 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost. Why that example?
L105457 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could accomplish its efficiency without sadism.
L105458 +++$+++ u1249 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Even historians fail to learn from history. They repeat the same mistakes. Let the killing end. Let
L105459 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is he dead, Captain?
L105460 +++$+++ u1082 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ENEG +++$+++ It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead. </font></p
L105461 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation.
L105462 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God.
L105463 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning.
L105464 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say?
L105465 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power.
L105466 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, you obviously don't understand
L105467 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept
L105468 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll say. Spock, this is
L105469 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir?
L105470 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it? Tell me about that.
L105471 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control.
L105472 +++$+++ u1046 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ How do you know so much about it, Commander?
L105473 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The asic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's.
L105474 +++$+++ u1046 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You've got a great job, Jim. All you have to do is sit back and let the machine do the work. for test manoeuvres.
L105475 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man.
L105476 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in on it.
L105477 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon. </font></p nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim, you haven't had much to say about this.
L105478 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock.
L105479 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am honoured, Doctor.
L105480 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir. Mister Harper.
L105481 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this.
L105482 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this.
L105483 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact.
L105484 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Is it supposed to do that?
L105485 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If I can be of assistance, Doctor.
L105486 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ We're coming back on our original course, Captain.
L105487 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ M-5 has performed admirably so far.
L105488 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Docto Daystrom.
L105489 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a furthe demonstration of M-5's capability.
L105490 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer.
L105491 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Docto Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career.
L105492 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Report, Mister Spock.
L105493 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of islands, life form readings.
L105494 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Check it out, Scotty.
L105495 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ M-5's readout, Captain.
L105496 +++$+++ u1216 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DAYSTROM +++$+++ Judgment, Captain?
L105497 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical selections.
L105498 +++$+++ u1216 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DAYSTROM +++$+++ And currently unoccupied.
L105499 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before.
L105500 +++$+++ u1216 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DAYSTROM +++$+++ Quite right. As the unit is called upon to do more work, it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still.
L105501 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it.
L105502 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for.
L105503 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow, one on the stern. Distance, two hundred thousand kilometres and closing.
L105504 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Captain, the M-5 unit has already identified the vessels as Federation starships Excalibur and Lexington.
L105505 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a surprise attack as a problem for the M-5.
L105506 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Phasers one one hundredth power, sir.
L105507 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain.
L105508 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Firing again.
L105509 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Attacking vessels are moving off.
L105510 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Report on damage sustained in mock attack.
L105511 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage.
L105512 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log.
L105513 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control.
L105514 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. It might even be practical.
L105515 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve unde them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it, or him.
L105516 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel?  What does it mean, Jim?  Spock? What does it mean?
L105517 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose.
L105518 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk here.
L105519 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel. </font></p
L105520 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel. </font></p
L105521 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ M-5 has identified her, Captain. The Woden. Listed in Starfleet Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation. No crew. Coming into visual range.
L105522 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Reverse thrusts will not engage, sir. Manual override isn't working either.
L105523 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain.
L105524 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ These controls are locked. We can't disengage the computer.
L105525 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power.
L105526 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Returning to original course and speed.
L105527 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ All systems report normal, Captain.
L105528 +++$+++ u1216 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DAYSTROM +++$+++ It's not my doing, Kirk.
L105529 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself.
L105530 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way?
L105531 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter-antimatter reserves.
L105532 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, Scotty, come with me.
L105533 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation, and engineering functions.
L105534 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour. We must regain control of the ship by then.
L105535 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit elays might be disrupted from engineering level three.
L105536 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even him.
L105537 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically.
L105538 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating.
L105539 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. But it is interesting.
L105540 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. But it is interesting.
L105541 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Good.
L105542 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it.
L105543 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock to Captain Kirk.
L105544 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk here.
L105545 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ We are ready, Captain.
L105546 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L105547 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control.
L105548 +++$+++ u1216 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DAYSTROM +++$+++ Please, please!
L105549 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Manual override is in control, Captain.
L105550 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Sir, G nine five system appears dead. </font></p
L105551 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Ensign.
L105552 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Ensign.
L105553 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It appears, Captain, we've been doing what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system.
L105554 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ But it was active. I'd stake all that I know that it was.
L105555 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals.
L105556 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ While it was getting ready for what? Spock?

L105573 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5 circuits.
L105574 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Of course.
L105575 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to elieve you would harm it.
L105576 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a computer. It's talking to him.
L105577 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Docto Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind.

L105590 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man. The computer that carried his engrams also believed it.
L105591 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set.
L105592 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Care to debate that, Spock?
L105593 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better.
L105594 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ But tell me, which do you prefer to have around?
L105595 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question.

L105615 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape without firing.
L105616 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GALLOWAY +++$+++ No, Captain. They're too wild. They act almost insane.
L105617 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements. One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death. They seem incredibly vicious. Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing for an attack. There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills eyond. However, he was less than truthful in one very important matter.

L105621 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser. I have found villagers who will corroborate it.
L105622 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Now wait a minute. He lost his ship and his crew, and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people.
L105623 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty.
L105624 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers. Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him?
L105625 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However, you must at least confiscate his phaser.
L105626 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Don't they ever rest?
L105627 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not that I have observed, Captain. Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied.
L105628 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Spock.  At least tell me why you want to kill me.
L105629 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Good, Captain. Try to reason with them. Keep trying, Captain. Their behaviour is highly illogical.
L105630 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Pity you can't teach me that.

L105633 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here. The only reasonable explanation would be a war. Nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust.

L105641 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can cross-circuit this unit.
L105642 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes. I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here. The virus still exists. Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil.
L105643 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it.
L105644 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Who knows? It might eventually cure the common cold, but lengthen lives? Poppycock. I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly.
L105645 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ready, Captain. Quite crude. Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship.
L105646 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L105647 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm weak, Captain, but not in difficulty.
L105648 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ He must have attention soon.
L105649 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need fo departure is even more immediate.
L105650 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts, the hills
L105651 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. I see, Captain. They would've learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance.

L105653 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Kohms? Communists? The parallel is almost too close, Captain. It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet.
L105654 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, we've got to do something!

L105667 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A most difficult decision, Captain.

L105679 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do anything that changes history

L105722 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, what is this?
L105723 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area.
L105724 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Tricorder readings, Mister Spock?
L105725 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning.
L105726 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
L105727 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function. Apparently that Melkotian buoy
L105728 +++$+++ u1026 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MELKOT +++$+++ You are outside. You are disease. The disease must be destroyed. Your plea has been heard, and sentence has been pronounced. It is done. </font></p
L105729 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L105730 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, evaluation?
L105731 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880.
L105732 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete.
L105733 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.
L105734 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Beautiful specimen.
L105735 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Crude but dangerous.
L105736 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But why here? And why now?
L105737 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place fo our punishment.
L105738 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier.
L105739 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern fo our execution.
L105740 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881.
L105741 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us.
L105742 +++$+++ u1121 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BEHAN +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't let them scare you away. They're a bunch of hot air if you ask me.
L105743 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are they really?
L105744 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton.
L105745 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history. The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western secto of America. the United States of America, that is.
L105746 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone. The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday.
L105747 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out.
L105748 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history
L105749 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ History cannot be changed.  wearing a badge shoots another man. The group run over.)
L105750 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ It's impossible! Things like this can't happen.
L105751 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is this a dead man, Doctor?
L105752 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp.
L105753 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately. Without moving a muscle of either hand. If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw. It initiated unfortunate events.
L105754 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Five of you. You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right, I will. Soon enough. Soon enough.
L105755 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov.
L105756 +++$+++ u1156 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BARMAN +++$+++ Sylvia's right. They've been bad-mouthing something fierce all over town. You boys watch it.
L105757 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely.
L105758 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain.
L105759 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The day is still young, Ensign.
L105760 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881. The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here.
L105761 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon.
L105762 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Could we make a communicator?
L105763 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours.
L105764 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions. Where's Chekov?
L105765 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Chekov is involved, Captain.
L105766 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, that settles that. A force field.
L105767 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town.
L105768 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well let's get there.
L105769 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor.
L105770 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser!
L105771 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I could make a device to deliver it on target.
L105772 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target?
L105773 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.
L105774 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye.
L105775 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade. </font></p
L105776 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Scotty, they're trying to push us into something we're not ready for.
L105777 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And it is not yet our time. </font></p
L105778 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go.
L105779 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us. Specifically, our future.
L105780 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer.
L105781 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I understand the feeling, Captain.
L105782 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock?
L105783 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor.
L105784 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones, Scotty.
L105785 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human.
L105786 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ We don't have much time.
L105787 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous attle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused.
L105788 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ About what?
L105789 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the othe Billy, would he not?
L105790 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ William Claiborne, that's right.
L105791 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral?
L105792 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Get to the point, Spock.
L105793 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived.
L105794 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L105795 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Another hour.
L105796 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade?
L105797 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not precisely.
L105798 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Forget precision. Will it work?
L105799 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It should.
L105800 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ And if we fight them, we all die. We know that.
L105801 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain.
L105802 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must e a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history.
L105803 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down.
L105804 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this.
L105805 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor.
L105806 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor.
L105807 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain?
L105808 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How soon will that be ready?
L105809 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Right now.
L105810 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How did you manage to test it?
L105811 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It has not been tested.
L105812 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye.  It's to kill the pain.
L105813 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But this is painless.
L105814 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It doesn't work.
L105815 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L105816 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It was our last chance.
L105817 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but it must function.
L105818 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work.
L105819 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order.
L105820 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Then we'd better become experts, and fast.
L105821 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That may not be necessary.
L105822 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, you've got something?
L105823 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored. Existence cannot be without them.
L105824 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What do you mean, Spock?
L105825 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been effective.
L105826 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It would've been effective anywhere else.
L105827 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov?
L105828 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ A piece of lead in his body.
L105829 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Wrong. His mind killed him.
L105830 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us.
L105831 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal.
L105832 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead.
L105833 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses. Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules. We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real, therefore they can kill.
L105834 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.
L105835 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He may indeed be dead. We do not know.
L105836 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us.
L105837 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me.
L105838 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save ou lives.
L105839 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely.
L105840 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt.
L105841 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.
L105842 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld.
L105843 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, sir. Engineer?
L105844 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, sir. Engineer?
L105845 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts.
L105846 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts.
L105847 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist.
L105848 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ They do not exist.  Nothing but ghosts of reality. They are lies. Falsehoods. Spectres without body. They are to be ignored.  Corral.)
L105849 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain.
L105850 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to him except the girl.
L105851 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the Melkotian object.
L105852 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sensor readings.
L105853 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, Captain.
L105854 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Lieutenant, sound Red Alert. Mister Chekov, deflector shields on full. Phaser gun crews, lock on target.
L105855 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain.
L105856 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Warp factor two, sir.
L105857 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal.
L105858 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock.
L105859 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?
L105860 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ But he didn't kill, Mister Spock.
L105861 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But he wanted to, Doctor.
L105862 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock?
L105863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain.
L105864 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it was.
L105865 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mankind, ready to kill.
L105866 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's the way it was in 1881.
L105867 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I wonder how humanity managed to survive.
L105868 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, but why the secrecy? This star system's under Federation control.
L105869 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim jurisdiction.
L105870 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard.
L105871 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant.
L105872 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Body armour, nuclear weapons.
L105873 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that

L105875 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk.

L105879 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational.
L105880 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hydrogen cloud reflection?
L105881 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost appears intermittently.
L105882 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Speculation?

L105884 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Courtesy is for everyone around here, and you'll find you won't e able to exist on Troyius without it. Mister Scott, our Chief Engineer, has shown you his engineering department. That's a courtesy. You respond by saying thank you.

L105916 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation. Very neat.
L105917 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital?

L105919 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this?

L105944 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears. It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote.
L105945 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own antidote.
L105946 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've worked on
L105947 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did.
L105948 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote fo the Enterprise.
L105949 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you.
L105950 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in. It's unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a galaxy away. What are the odds on such duplication?
L105951 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way.
L105952 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Analysis, Spock.
L105953 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe. Readings can't even measure its age accurately. These incised symbols are fascinating. Evidently, some form of writing.
L105954 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any theories about what it is?
L105955 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own.
L105956 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock?
L105957 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Bearing one one seven mark four.
L105958 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And how much time did you say we have to investigate?
L105959 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes. Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem, perhaps past solution.
L105960 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You did say thirty minutes?
L105961 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L105962 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians.
L105963 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I elieve. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes.
L105964 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflecto system?
L105965 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here.
L105966 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms?
L105967 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Ou appearance here would only confuse and frighten them.

L105977 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon. Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship
L105978 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months, Spock!
L105979 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all.
L105980 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ In the meantime, what about Jim?
L105981 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and esume the search.

L105983 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain.
L105984 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Can a few more minutes matter, Spock?
L105985 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here.

L106007 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams.

L106009 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass.
L106010 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid.
L106011 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power.
L106012 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim won't be able to get out of its path.

L106030 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way, and you lost. You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim.
L106031 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I accept the responsibility, Doctor.
L106032 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ And my responsibility is the health of this crew. You've been driving yourself too hard, and I want you to get some rest.

L106039 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's symbols. They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing.
L106040 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet. Fifty eight days.
L106041 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those symbols are the key.
L106042 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse.
L106043 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks.
L106044 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood
L106045 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is.
L106046 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I prescribed sleep.
L106047 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not words. They are musical notes.
L106048 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song?
L106049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet.
L106050 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Were you able to make sense our of the symbols?
L106051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy escuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow.
L106052 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy.
L106053 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them.
L106054 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries. The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet.
L106055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which has now become defective and is failing to operate.
L106056 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order, otherwise
L106057 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely, Doctor.

L106085 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual.
L106086 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It worked.
L106087 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, were you inside this structure?
L106088 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.
L106089 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time.
L106090 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't know how to get inside.
L106091 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflecto mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed.
L106092 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them.
L106093 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes.
L106094 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument?
L106095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence.
L106096 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels. I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship.
L106097 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you could remember your exact words, Captain.
L106098 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering.
L106099 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence.
L106100 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ More symbols. Can you read them?
L106101 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in thei proper

L106103 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I did give a full report
L106104 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then, Mister Spock, comply.
L106105 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain.
L106106 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir.
L106107 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear. Nothing in our immediate vicinity.
L106108 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's a Klingon ship! But it couldn't be, not in this area.
L106109 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.

L106111 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A second ship has appeared.  Correction, there are now three. We are surrounded.
L106112 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened?
L106113 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have a theory, Captain.
L106114 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Lieutenant.  They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now.
L106115 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure.
L106116 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's my ship they want, and very badly.
L106117 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would be a great prize.

L106119 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which enders our tracking sensors useless.
L106120 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ If the Enterprise is taken by Romulans, they'll know everything there is to know about a starship.
L106121 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made.
L106122 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ I don't think so, but we have an important matter to discuss. And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion. You are the first officer?
L106123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spock.
L106124 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ The captain has made his statement.
L106125 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I understand.
L106126 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ I must admit some surprise on seeing you, Spock. We were not aware of Vulcans aboard the Enterprise.
L106127 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel.
L106128 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ He is a Vulcan. Our forebears had the same roots and origins. Something you wouldn't understand, Captain. We can appreciate the Vulcans, our distant brothers. I have heard of Vulcan integrity and personal honour. There's a well-known saying, or is it a myth, that Vulcans are incapable of lying?
L106129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is no myth.
L106130 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Then tell me truthfully now, by your honour as a Vulcan, what was your mission?
L106131 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan.
L106132 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge.
L106133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan. It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself.
L106134 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ We have not even begun! There's no force that I can use on a Vulcan that will make him speak. That is a fact. But there are Romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses.
L106135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove ineffective against the captain.
L106136 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let her rant. There's nothing to say.
L106137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several weeks.
L106138 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's a lie!
L106139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision.
L106140 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Shut up, Spock!
L106141 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable. Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness.
L106142 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You filthy liar!
L106143 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory.
L106144 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll kill you, you filthy traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
L106145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He is not sane.
L106146 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ A Vulcan among humans. Living, working with them. I would think the situation would be intolerable to you.
L106147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human.
L106148 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ To whom is your allegiance then? Do you call yourself Terran or Vulcan?
L106149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Vulcan.
L106150 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock?
L106151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Eighteen years.
L106152 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ And you serve Captain Kirk. Do you like him? Do you like your shipmates?
L106153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The question is irrelevant.
L106154 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Possibly, but you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders, even to his whims.
L106155 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My duty as an officer is to obey him.
L106156 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ You are a superior being. Why do you not command?
L106157 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not desire a ship of my own.
L106158 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that opportunity?
L106159 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Such opportunities are extremely rare.
L106160 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments, opportunities are made and will be. I will see to that, if you'll stop looking on the Federation as the whole universe. It is not, you know.
L106161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.
L106162 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ You must have your own ship.
L106163 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship. You want the Enterprise.
L106164 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ I neglected to mention, I'll expect you for dinner. We have much to discuss.
L106165 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed.
L106166 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Allow me to rephrase. Will you join me for dinner?
L106167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited?
L106168 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Mister Spock. That corridor is forbidden to all but loyal Romulans.
L106169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Of course. I shall obey your restrictions.
L106170 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ I hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions.
L106171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable. </font></p
L106172 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Mister Spock, the doctor has now confirmed your testimony as to the mental state of your captain. He was and is unfit to continue in command of the Enterprise. That duty has fallen on you. Are you ready to exercise that function?
L106173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am ready.
L106174 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, I don't believe it. There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out.
L106175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor.
L106176 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ That's enough, Doctor. As a physician, your duty is to save lives. Mister Spock's duty is to lead the Enterprise and its crew to a safe haven.
L106177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further.
L106178 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What did you do? What did you do?
L106179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip.
L106180 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll need a Romulan uniform.
L106181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am very flattered, Commander. There's no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise. It is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement.
L106182 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ You have nothing in Starfleet to which to return. I offer, we offer you an alternative. We will find a place for you, if you wish it.
L106183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A place?
L106184 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ With me. Romulan women are not like Vulcan females. We are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion. Ou people are warriors. Often savage. But we are also many other pleasant things.
L106185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society.
L106186 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ As a Vulcan, you would study it. As a human you would find ways to appreciate it.
L106187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Please believe me. I do appreciate it.
L106188 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ I am so glad. Now one final step to make the occasion complete. You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the Enterprise, and there you will take your rightful place as its commander. And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port, with my flagship at its side.
L106189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will do even better. Would it not, Commander?
L106190 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Yes. Yes, it will, Mister Spock. You do know I have a first name.
L106191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was beginning to wonder.
L106192 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Well, I do. Would you like to hear it?
L106193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier.
L106194 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ If you will give me a moment, the soldier will transform herself into a woman.
L106195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spock to Captain Kirk.
L106196 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK  +++$+++ Kirk here.

L106198 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Is my attire now more appropriate, Mister Spock?
L106199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation.
L106200 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ It's hard to believe that I can be so moved by the touch of an alien hand.
L106201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is illogical.
L106202 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Full alert. Search all decks.
L106203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will find it.
L106204 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ You must be mad.
L106205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I assure you I am quite sane.
L106206 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Why would you do this to me? What are you that you could do this?
L106207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ First officer of the Enterprise.  What is your present form of execution? get it working. I hope Mister Spock can buy us the time we need. and walks onto the Bridge.)
L106208 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Execution of state criminals is both painful and unpleasant. I believe the details are unnecessary. The sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges have been recorded.
L106209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I demand the Right of Statement first.
L106210 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ You understand Romulan tradition well. The right is granted.
L106211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you. I shall not require much time. No more than twenty minutes, I should say.
L106212 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ It should take less time than that to find your ally, who stole the cloaking device. You will not die alone. Recording the Romulan Right of Statement. Proceed, Commander Spock.
L106213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt.  The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty.
L106214 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Everyone carries out his duty. You state the obvious, Spock.
L106215 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement. May I continue?
L106216 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel?
L106217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing very rapidly.
L106218 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Of course. It's expected.
L106219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ One hundred thousand kilometres. They should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds.
L106220 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Three one eight mark seven, sir. Executing.
L106221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The cloaking device is working perfectly, and the commander has informed me that even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped.
L106222 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ The Federation. And what did you want?
L106223 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel.
L106224 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ And that's exactly all you came away with.
L106225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You underestimate yourself, Commander.
L106226 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ You realise that very soon we will learn to penetrate the cloaking device you stole.
L106227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously. Military secrets are the most fleeting of all. I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent.

L106235 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked.
L106236 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be.
L106237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise term. Induced by an outside force.

L106251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm not aware of it, Captain.
L106252 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.

L106257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses.

L106263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent.

L106264 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That could be what destroyed him.
L106265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth.
L106266 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived here?
L106267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi. After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon.

L106275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship.

L106325 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Is that you, Doctor McCoy, and are you with the Captain?

L106327 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Engineer Scott as well. Unfortunately, I do not know where I am.
L106328 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We'll get you, Spock. It won't be long.
L106329 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ A practical idea, Captain. It seems unlikely that I shall e able to get to you.
L106330 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones, give them something to keep them out for a while.  Spock. Spock. Come on, Spock. Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock.
L106331 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Yes, Captain, I am still here. Have you returned to the Enterprise?
L106332 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for. Is it medical?
L106333 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ I am not certain. I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity.
L106334 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Body? Why, you have none.
L106335 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Then what am l?
L106336 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You are a disembodied brain.
L106337 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Fascinating. It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping lood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature.
L106338 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, we don't have time for that.
L106339 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Why are you endangering your lives by coming here?

L106343 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not elieve he has the knowledge to restore a brain.

L106345 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy. That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy.
L106346 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The skill to remove it exists right where we are. Restoring it must also be possible. That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can.
L106347 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my ehalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a easonable chance for success. Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since
L106348 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Eighteen hours and twelve minutes.
L106349 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Doctor McCoy must've told you that twenty four hours is the maximum my body can
L106350 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock.
L106351 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not?
L106352 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. Very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately. Beam us a signal so we can home in on you.
L106353 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Acknowledged.

L106359 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I know that does not make much sense.

L106410 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ Thank you, but the assignment's not yet definite. It will depend upon my ability to achieve a true mind-link with the Ambassador.
L106411 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.
L106412 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ I wasn't aware that anyone had ever achieved a mind-link with the Medusans.
L106413 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species.
L106414 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ I've heard, Mister Spock, that you turned down the assignment with the Ambassador.

L106421 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I almost envy you your assignment.
L106422 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ I see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place.
L106423 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine. Were you born a telepath?
L106424 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ Yes. That is why I had to study on Vulcan.
L106425 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I understand. May I show you to your quarters?
L106426 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ I think I'll stay here a bit. Ambassador Kollos often finds the process of transport somewhat unsettling.
L106427 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint. Do call when you are ready.
L106428 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Tell me, Doctor Jones. Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock I can understand. Nothing makes an impression on him.
L106429 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why, thank you, Captain.
L106430 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You poor girl.
L106431 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was indeed fortunate.
L106432 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't understand.
L106433 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain.
L106434 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ Vulcan was necessary to my sanity.
L106435 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions.
L106436 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Doctor Jones.
L106437 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, Doctor.
L106438 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be. Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad? Why do you do it?
L106439 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion, promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be eautiful.
L106440 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Of course. Perhaps I'll see
L106441 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'll escort you to your quarters.
L106442 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good night, Scotty. You dressed up for the occasion, Spock. Very impressive.
L106443 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening, gentlemen.
L106444 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Larry Marvick? Why?
L106445 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you know whether he saw the Medusan?
L106446 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ Yes, he did.
L106447 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous insanity.
L106448 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock?

L106451 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed facto nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum.

L106453 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Ou instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy.
L106454 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then we should be able to navigate back.
L106455 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a eturn course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot e-cross the barrier using sub light speed.

L106459 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos.

L106462 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hazards?
L106463 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link.
L106464 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of apport she has with Kollos.
L106465 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain, particularly in the depth of her jealousy.
L106466 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I could confine her to quarters.
L106467 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude.
L106468 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ Let me go. You have no idea what a dangerous thing Spock is planning. We must stop him! Let me go!
L106469 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be involved.
L106470 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRANDA +++$+++ Why? I've already committed myself to mind-link when Kollos and I reach the Medusan vessel. Why put yourself in jeopardy?
L106471 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do.
L106472 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What?
L106473 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L106474 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic. You are blind, and there are some things you simply cannot do.

L106476 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, of course. It's the only reasonable explanation. You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you.
L106477 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones.

L106560 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous. I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work.
L106561 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory.
L106562 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, he's right. Continue.
L106563 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source.
L106564 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you tap into it?
L106565 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us.
L106566 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And get us out of here the same way we were brought in.
L106567 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I would say so.
L106568 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How's it coming, Spock?
L106569 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all.
L106570 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And space travel is?
L106571 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface.
L106572 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm a doctor, not a coal miner.
L106573 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments.
L106574 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matte how many notes you left.
L106575 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so.
L106576 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you what you need and when you need it. Would you rather have the bends? That's it. Just lie down and relax.
L106577 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How long will he be asleep, Doctor?
L106578 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape.
L106579 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation considerably.
L106580 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ How?
L106581 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians eturn, I shall go with them.
L106582 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot
L106583 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine.  Spock's shoulder, and smiles. McCoy comes up behind him and gives him an injection.)
L106584 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine.  Spock's shoulder, and smiles. McCoy comes up behind him and gives him an injection.)
L106585 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands.
L106586 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Get on with it.
L106587 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good doctor's hypo.
L106588 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Anything?
L106589 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device.
L106590 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What exactly is it?
L106591 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it. It is activated solely by mental commands.
L106592 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern?
L106593 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I
L106594 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it.
L106595 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it.
L106596 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And that we would use it to escape.
L106597 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.
L106598 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And they keep McCoy.
L106599 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is evidently their intention, Captain.
L106600 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this. Even before we got here, she was a prisoner. They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her.
L106601 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to thei purpose.
L106602 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you?
L106603 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise.
L106604 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Will it take us to McCoy?
L106605 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you so desire.
L106606 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists.  His pulse is almost gone. How is he?
L106607 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence of massive circulatory collapse.
L106608 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship. What is it? What's the matter?
L106609 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all.
L106610 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You don't know. You're not a doctor.
L106611 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen. Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver. Seventy percent kidney failure.
L106612 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How long?
L106613 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It could happen anytime.
L106614 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can't we do something?
L106615 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
L106616 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her?
L106617 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we cannot be positive.
L106618 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ THANN +++$+++ Perhaps.
L106619 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to ing you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova.
L106620 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ THANN +++$+++ We know.
L106621 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed.
L106622 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ THANN +++$+++ Time grows short.
L106623 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has een caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test.
L106624 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAL +++$+++ No. No, not yet.
L106625 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The Vians too must be capable of saving his life.
L106626 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own. I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it.
L106627 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain?
L106628 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it?
L106629 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field.
L106630 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L106631 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field.
L106632 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAL +++$+++ No. We will not. Her instinct must be developed to the fullest. The test must be complete.
L106633 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for he planet. She offered her life.
L106634 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LAL +++$+++ Farewell.
L106635 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What is puzzling you, Captain?
L106636 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem.
L106637 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians.
L106638 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news?
L106639 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due.

L106641 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors.
L106642 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Specify.
L106643 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings.
L106644 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What about sensor failure?
L106645 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems.
L106646 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How about it, Spock?
L106647 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L106648 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Explain.

L106650 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ Has there ever been a mutiny on a starship before?
L106651 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign.
L106652 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim. The Captain's neck is broken.
L106653 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard.
L106654 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT  +++$+++ Aye, aye, Captain.
L106655 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel.
L106656 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise?
L106657 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L106658 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock.
L106659 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the data.
L106660 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Request denied.
L106661 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, there is a chance
L106662 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back with the information. I'll be right there. Scotty, energise transporter. the Enterprise.)
L106663 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Energise.
L106664 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Anything?
L106665 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative.
L106666 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's it. I've done all I can. There's nothing out there to grab a hold of and bring in. When that ship went, it must have taken the Captain with it.
L106667 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Compute the next period of spatial interphase.
L106668 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Two hours and twelve minutes? That power leak has unbalanced the ship and she's starting to drift. I can't hold her in place that long.
L106669 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the Captain alive.
L106670 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I don't understand what's so special about this region of space.
L106671 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space. At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an area of ours. That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect with the Defiant's universe.
L106672 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Mister Spock? We will be able to retrieve the Captain at that time, won't we?
L106673 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped ourselves.
L106674 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ And die like him?  grabs him and McCoy arrives to help. Spock grabs his face.)
L106675 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Chekov! Chekov!
L106676 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Chekov! Chekov!

L106678 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What happened, Mister Spock?
L106679 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of ou problems in this situation when he attacked.
L106680 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint.
L106681 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov. The same fury which was evident in the Defiant.
L106682 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable.
L106683 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is there anything you need to isolate the cause?
L106684 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant.
L106685 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move.
L106686 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ How long will that take?
L106687 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.
L106688 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive?
L106689 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide eathable air for no more than three point six two hours.

L106748 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most promising substance tested so far. We're progressing.
L106749 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory.
L106750 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my personal attention, Mister Spock.
L106751 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only fo them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has een disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive.
L106752 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint.
L106753 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts.
L106754 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which equires our presence.
L106755 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge.
L106756 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be eviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just declared Jim dead.

L106758 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status?

L106762 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Maybe not the same one. I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought.
L106763 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the isk of his own life or even his own ship.
L106764 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to stay. Why?
L106765 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the Captain's status.
L106766 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of that.
L106767 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do.
L106768 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into.
L106769 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged ou esponsibilities here.
L106770 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't elieve that you would want Jim's command. You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise.
L106771 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise.
L106772 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I would like to remedy that situation.

L106888 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition.
L106889 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor?
L106890 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you should know now. It's xenopolycythemia.

L106895 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command.
L106896 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but it's better than exterminating them.

L106909 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as these people do, to protect themselves.

L106990 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary.

L106993 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately, and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities.

L106997 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would appear that the entity wants us alive.
L106998 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds?

L107009 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought togethe opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict.
L107010 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it.
L107011 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end and soon.

L107013 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it.
L107014 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard. Now do you believe? Enterprise. Stop the war now, or spend eternity in futile bloody violence.
L107015 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's nothing we can do about it.

L107048 +++$+++ u1200 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PARMEN +++$+++ Do not take that tone with me.
L107049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise.
L107050 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ He may still need the ship's medical stores. Why prevent contact?
L107051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain.
L107052 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, Mister Spock. One thing for certain. Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety.
L107053 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so utally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise.
L107054 +++$+++ u1200 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PARMEN +++$+++ We manage to live in peace and harmony.
L107055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice.
L107056 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.
L107057 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Two spacemen marching to a drum.
L107058 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ There is no medicine that can help him. He'll have to come through this himself.
L107059 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain.
L107060 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ My muscles are sore, that's all.
L107061 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I can understand.
L107062 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The release of emotions, Mister Spock, is what keeps us healthy. Emotionally healthy, that is.
L107063 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy elease of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you.
L107064 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution.
L107065 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ So it would seem. Captain.
L107066 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Spock.
L107067 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you still feel anger toward Parmen?
L107068 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Great anger.
L107069 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And you, Doctor?
L107070 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, Spock. And hatred.
L107071 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must master it. I must control.
L107072 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No, not until we came to this planet.
L107073 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop?
L107074 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ How could I forget that? It was exactly six months and fourteen days after we got here that they started pushing me around.
L107075 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you?
L107076 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Well, four, I think. Or three.
L107077 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their powe developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods.
L107078 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That's right.
L107079 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods.
L107080 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others?
L107081 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element.
L107082 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Of course. Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions.
L107083 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some iochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.
L107084 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it.
L107085 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also egulate body growth.
L107086 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh. You mean the same thing that kept me from having the power made me a dwarf?
L107087 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power.
L107088 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes. There are thirty eight of them.
L107089 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen.
L107090 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream.
L107091 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks efore there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us.
L107092 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot?
L107093 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have experienced a slight flush, Captain.
L107094 +++$+++ u1200 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PARMEN +++$+++ Doctor, please. You have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies. We must recapture it at once. I know. What would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman?  his lyre.)
L107095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be watchful of young men in their velvet prime.  leaving bitter dregs. Ah, bitter dregs.  much"  treasure in cold morning light. Ah, in cold morning light"
L107096 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ I'm so ashamed. Please make them stop.
L107097 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have tried.
L107098 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Please, please make them stop.
L107099 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you.
L107100 +++$+++ u1176 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ERACLITUS +++$+++ Impossible!
L107101 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Quite possible and logical.
L107102 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L107103 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you.
L107104 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock?
L107105 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned.
L107106 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No sign of present life?
L107107 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further.
L107108 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call. What happened?
L107109 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown at present, Captain.
L107110 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Freeze it.
L107111 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message.
L107112 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find these people. They were there, now they're not. Nor is Crewman Compton.
L107113 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible.
L107114 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in.
L107115 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Captain, I have a reading from Life Support centre
L107116 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Lieutenant, ship wide order. Use communicators instead of intercom. Issue phasers to all crew members. Spock, repeat.
L107117 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances eing introduced.
L107118 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock?
L107119 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location.
L107120 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Phasers on stun. Sweep the area.  the two security men are stopped again by the force field.)
L107121 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter. I should advise caution. </font></p
L107122 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it?
L107123 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin.
L107124 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it.
L107125 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Life support is still operating. I would say that the installation is incomplete.
L107126 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves!
L107127 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all.
L107128 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A show of strength.
L107129 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. </font></p
L107130 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. </font></p
L107131 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Affirmative.
L107132 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Read out.
L107133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded?
L107134 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Affirmative.
L107135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nature and description of enemy forces.
L107136 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Data insufficient.
L107137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Number of enemy forces.
L107138 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Data insufficient.
L107139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Purpose of the invasion?
L107140 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Immediate purpose, seizure and control of Federation Sta ship Enterprise and crew. Data insufficient for determination of end purpose.
L107141 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance?
L107142 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Data insufficient.
L107143 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are we at present capable of resisting?
L107144 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Negative.
L107145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your recommendation?
L107146 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L107147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your recommendations, Captain?
L107148 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Captain. Captain Kirk! He's gone!
L107149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant, did you see what happened?
L107150 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Well, he was sitting there. He'd just drunk his coffee and set his cup down. You see it's still there. And then he vanished.
L107151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Sulu, do you verify?
L107152 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Yes.
L107153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did anyone else?
L107154 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I had some.
L107155 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I?
L107156 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Was it the coffee? Are we going to go too, just like the captain?
L107157 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed.
L107158 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ By that time it'll be too late.
L107159 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be in the medical lab.
L107160 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos.
L107161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge.
L107162 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ McCoy to Spock.
L107163 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Spock here.
L107164 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I've found a tape in the computer down here, and when I try to ead it, all I get is a whine.
L107165 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Bring it to the bridge at once, Doctor. </font></p that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze. The unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative.
L107166 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEELA  +++$+++ The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will be too late.
L107167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew.
L107168 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force field and get at that unit?
L107169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level.
L107170 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs?
L107171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporte oom.
L107172 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEELA +++$+++ Maybe that's why I liked you so much. Because you were like him.  Rael? You don't have to worry about the captain. He's made the adjustment.
L107173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively.
L107174 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain?
L107175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ By drinking the Scalosian water.
L107176 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you.
L107177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor. Fascinating.
L107178 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DEELA +++$+++ Now, what about your problem, Captain, and your Vulcan friend?
L107179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise.
L107180 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, Mister Spock, what have you got?
L107181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water. Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it.
L107182 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's test it.  Nothing's happening.
L107183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain.
L107184 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself.
L107185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience.
L107186 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ A ghost planet?
L107187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets.
L107188 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's take the facts one by one. That should explain something.
L107189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period.
L107190 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.
L107191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth.
L107192 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That would be difficult to explain.
L107193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time.
L107194 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And yet it has.
L107195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon.
L107196 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But a fascinating one, Mister Spock.
L107197 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Precisely, Captain.
L107198 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Feed beam down co-ordinates to the transporter room. Mister Sulu, you'll accompany me. Mister Spock, you have the conn.
L107199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately.
L107200 +++$+++ u1258 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ D'AMATO +++$+++ Captain. Captain!
L107201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done.
L107202 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ What happened?
L107203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair.
L107204 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ No, Mister Spock. I meant what happened to us?
L107205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That we have yet to ascertain.
L107206 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ M'BENGA  +++$+++ Sickbay, Doctor M'Benga.
L107207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Report on the death of the transporter officer. </font></p possible malfunction.
L107208 +++$+++ u1111 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAHDA +++$+++ No debris of any kind, sir. I've made two full scans. If the planet had broken up, there'd be some sign. But what bothers me is the stars, Mister Spock.
L107209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The stars.
L107210 +++$+++ u1111 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAHDA +++$+++ Yes, sir. They're wrong.
L107211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Wrong?
L107212 +++$+++ u1111 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAHDA +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock. Look. Now here's a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion.
L107213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A positional change.
L107214 +++$+++ u1111 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAHDA +++$+++ It doesn't make any sense. But somehow I'd say that in a flash we've been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were.

L107216 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ But that's not possible. Nothing can do that.
L107217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years.
L107218 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ The point is, it shouldn't have hurled us anywhere. Why, it should have destroyed us immediately, vaporised us.
L107219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know. There was no period of unconsciousness. Our ship's chronometers egistered a matter of only a few seconds. Therefore, we were displaced through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom.
L107220 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ What you're saying is that the planet didn't blow up, and the captain and the others, they're still alive!
L107221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Please, Mister Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic. I have said nothing. I was merely speculating.
L107222 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ M'BENGA  +++$+++ Sickbay to Mister Spock.
L107223 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Spock here. </font></p disruption. </font></p Kirk and his party left. Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed.
L107224 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, sir. But even at that it'll take a while to get there.
L107225 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you give me warp eight?
L107226 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more. I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them.
L107227 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course.
L107228 +++$+++ u1111 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAHDA +++$+++ Already plotted and laid in, sir.
L107229 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight.
L107230 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't know, but something or someone did. half solar hours.
L107231 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you would be more precise. </font></p

L107233 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct. </font></p
L107234 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT  +++$+++ My assistant, Watkins, is dead.
L107235 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott?
L107236 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman.
L107237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous. Security alert. All decks.
L107238 +++$+++ u1090 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ M'BENGA  +++$+++ Yes, we have, Mister Spock.
L107239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer? </font></p to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger.
L107240 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ You mean that one of the people who threw us a thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people?
L107241 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott.
L107242 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Then you're right, Mister Spock. Watkins must've been murdered. I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor. There are no exposed circuits there. It couldn't have been anything he touched.
L107243 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger.
L107244 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L107245 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security.
L107246 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Aye, sir. All decks, cancel Red Alert. Maintain increased security.
L107247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative.
L107248 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ How did she get off the ship, sir?
L107249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Presumably the same way she got on.
L107250 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Yes, sir. Mister Spock what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive?
L107251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live.
L107252 +++$+++ u1111 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAHDA +++$+++ Aye, sir. Warp seven. Mister Spock, our speed has increased to warp eight point nine and still climbing.
L107253 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed is still increasing. </font></p maximum overload in about fifteen minutes. </font></p will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth. </font></p
L107254 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ It's useless. And there's no question it's deliberate.
L107255 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sabotage.
L107256 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye, and a thorough job. The system's foolproof. Whoeve murdered Watkins sabotaged this.
L107257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You said it was fused. How?
L107258 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ That's what worries me.
L107259 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Worries, Mister Scott?
L107260 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Well, it's fused, all right, but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it.
L107261 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting.
L107262 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow up.
L107263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, but the method is fascinating.
L107264 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Whatever did this is still aboard this ship. I fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert.
L107265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage ou main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody.
L107266 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye.
L107267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber.
L107268 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ There's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates.
L107269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point.
L107270 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ What with? Bare hands?
L107271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A magnetic probe.
L107272 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion. And I'm not even sure a man can live in the crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter.
L107273 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall try.
L107274 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ You'll be killed, man!
L107275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us.
L107276 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye. You're right. What have we got to lose? But I'll do it, Mister Spock. I know every millimetre of that system. I'll do whatever has to be done.
L107277 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong.
L107278 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Aye. It was an emotional statement. I don't expect you to understand it.
L107279 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition.
L107280 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Mister Spock, we don't have time for that.
L107281 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the compute study.

L107283 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Go ahead, Mister Scott.

L107312 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed.
L107313 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago.
L107314 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Returned from where?
L107315 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a emarkable culture this is.
L107316 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer.
L107317 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But what people created this? Are there any representatives here?
L107318 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate them has been destroyed.
L107319 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is a loss, Captain.
L107320 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The previous ships probably spread the disease all through thei people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead.
L107321 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available. Losira's.

L107323 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly intelligent.

L107325 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed, Captain?
L107326 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHEKOV +++$+++ I think that may be a Starfleet shuttlecraft.
L107327 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov.

L107331 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural condition of this individual?
L107332 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced such a race of beings?
L107333 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain.
L107334 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is the result of a very dramatic conflict. Spock?
L107335 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to ecent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind.
L107336 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, I can't give you one, Jim. I've never worked on anyone like him or anything like him.
L107337 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were a human.

L107339 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain.

L107341 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is a vessel out there, Captain.
L107342 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device?
L107343 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew.
L107344 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Weaponry on the vessel, Spock?
L107345 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed ather than combat.
L107346 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Something out there can't be seen. Explanation?
L107347 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible.
L107348 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Invisible. Malfunction?
L107349 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is no sensor failure. The readings persist.
L107350 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Read out, Mister Spock.
L107351 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It just disintegrated. Fascinating.

L107353 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien presence.
L107354 +++$+++ u1134 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BELE +++$+++ It served me long and durably. Unfortunately, the strain of arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities. I was just able to complete this trip and disembark in time, or I would have disintegrated in space with it.
L107355 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.
L107356 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Explanation, Mister Spock?
L107357 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Elusive, Captain. I am investigating.

L107360 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Captain, we are now at warp ten and the speed is increasing!
L107361 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus.
L107362 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock.
L107363 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence number two, code one, one A, two B.
L107364 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders?
L107365 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron.
L107366 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus?
L107367 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circula course.
L107368 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ship's course?
L107369 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain.
L107370 +++$+++ u1259 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LOKAI +++$+++ Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions. After Ariannus, what is justice? I shall wait to see it dispensed.
L107371 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.
L107372 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Disgusting is what I call them.
L107373 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That description is not scientifically accurate.
L107374 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's do that.
L107375 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet.
L107376 +++$+++ u1134 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BELE +++$+++ Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree. Surely, stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of murdering thousands of people.
L107377 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We do not know that Lokai has done that.
L107378 +++$+++ u1134 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BELE +++$+++ It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an inferior breed.
L107379 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself.
L107380 +++$+++ u1134 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ BELE +++$+++ Lokai is white on the right side. All of his people are white on the right side.
L107381 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy Cheron.

L107407 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on Cheron.

L107409 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on Cheron.

L107419 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate?

L107432 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GARTH +++$+++ Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying. And in my gratitude, I offered them the galaxy. They rejected me, and I condemned them to death.
L107433 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits?

L107435 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it.
L107436 +++$+++ u1135 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GARTH +++$+++ Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate. That is all. Yet, Mister Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right, and in my fleet, you will surely have a Starship to command.

L107559 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner.

L107561 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him.

L107567 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary.
L107568 +++$+++ u1213 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ HODIN +++$+++ No. We are desperate.
L107569 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor.

L107597 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation.

L107599 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.
L107600 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light.
L107601 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature.
L107602 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L107603 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were inoperative.
L107604 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any damage to the warp engines?
L107605 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ None, Captain.
L107606 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get.
L107607 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it was not a storm.
L107608 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, explanation.
L107609 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure.

L107611 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain.
L107612 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid. I'm hailing on all frequencies. No response.
L107613 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no protective shields.
L107614 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No shields?
L107615 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary.
L107616 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha?
L107617 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex.
L107618 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain.
L107619 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain.
L107620 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Any life readings?
L107621 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ None.

L107623 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable.

L107625 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain.
L107626 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, have you seen anything like that before?
L107627 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative.
L107628 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality factors, Captain.
L107629 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The attack was thorough.
L107630 +++$+++ u1187 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MIRA +++$+++ I know. You'll be killed if we stay.
L107631 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims.
L107632 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm. Explain.
L107633 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon.
L107634 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it?
L107635 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were.
L107636 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted.
L107637 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself. </font></p
L107638 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is it closing?
L107639 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy.
L107640 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Your analysis, Spock. What is it?
L107641 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital.
L107642 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Who are they? Where are they from?
L107643 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Impossible to determine without programming for compute analysis.
L107644 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them?
L107645 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence.
L107646 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There must be some defence we can use.
L107647 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Thei attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which is most compatible.
L107648 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please, do not come any closer to our ship.
L107649 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps it did not understand.
L107650 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine.
L107651 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It appears so.
L107652 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If she is to survive, we can't attack.
L107653 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not directly.
L107654 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating?
L107655 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form.
L107656 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers?
L107657 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible.
L107658 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's see it.
L107659 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers.
L107660 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That might be a factor.
L107661 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And you are sure that this is the correct slide?
L107662 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine.
L107663 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units.
L107664 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Check it, Spock.  match exactly.)
L107665 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H.
L107666 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant Mira Romaine and tape H, brain circuitry patterns of alien life unit, identical. Identical.
L107667 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L107668 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ There has been no error.
L107669 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds taking place etween the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Thei thoughts are becoming hers. </font></p
L107670 +++$+++ u1208 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU  +++$+++ Its been useless, Captain.
L107671 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain.
L107672 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ She could kill us all in this state.
L107673 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned.
L107674 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's not Mira talking.
L107675 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still etains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using her voice.
L107676 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZETAR +++$+++ We are from Zetar.
L107677 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed.
L107678 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZETAR +++$+++ Do not fight us.
L107679 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They will not accept their own deaths.
L107680 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZETAR +++$+++ You will all die.
L107681 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat.
L107682 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The Zetars are growing stronger.
L107683 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The weightless state has become their natural condition.
L107684 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock.
L107685 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor.
L107686 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous.
L107687 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor.
L107688 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging.
L107689 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say he struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure.
L107690 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor?
L107691 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal fo that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However
L107692 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, I should think work would be a better therapy.
L107693 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Logical.

L107720 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two.
L107721 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow.

Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her. I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred. The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her.  efreshments.)

L107742 +++$+++ u1136 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ DROXINE +++$+++ The Troglytes are workers, Captain. Oh surely, you must be aware of that. They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil. Those things cannot be done here.

L107756 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here.
L107757 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported.
L107758 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months.
L107759 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off.
L107760 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ PLASUS  +++$+++ And do your computers explain how my ancestors, who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos while the Troglytes did not?

L107763 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to delive that consignment to Merak Two.
L107764 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the only thing that might convince her.

L107815 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ One.
L107816 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ We are One.

L107826 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need.

L107828 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are they in the Sickbay?
L107829 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain.
L107830 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists?
L107831 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man
L107832 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doctor Sevrin is their leader?
L107833 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies.
L107834 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive.
L107835 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created. It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes.
L107836 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ All do. The cave is deep in our memory.
L107837 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, that is true, Captain.
L107838 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them?
L107839 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar.
L107840 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock. What does Herbert mean?
L107841 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a mino official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought.
L107842 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to ehave?
L107843 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall make an attempt, Captain.
L107844 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig.
L107845 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir. aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, Ill be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance. </font></p
L107846 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir. aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, Ill be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance. </font></p
L107847 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For thei sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal. The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden.
L107848 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ As I have been barred.
L107849 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you knew you were a carrier.
L107850 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology ecause of what my body carries.
L107851 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders.
L107852 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ Because this is poison to me. This stuff you breathe, this stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet. The programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries. That's what your science have done to me. You've infected me. Only the primitives can cleanse me. I cannot purge myself until I am among them. Only their way of living is right. I must go to them.
L107853 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that.
L107854 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ I shall go to them and be One with them. And together we shall uild a world such as this galaxy has never seen. A world. A life. A life. So now you're going to try to persuade me that your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go.
L107855 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L107856 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed.
L107857 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L107858 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great espect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done.
L107859 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control?
L107860 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Am I crossing you?

L107862 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Hey, how about a session, you and us? It would sound. That's what I came for. I wanted to ask, you know, great white captain upstairs, ut he don't reach us. But would he shake on a session? I mean, we want to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm asking.
L107863 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes.
L107864 +++$+++ u1127 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ IRINA +++$+++ Not different. What I wanted to be. There is nothing wrong in doing what you want.
L107865 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving.
L107866 +++$+++ u1207 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SEVRIN +++$+++ I am. All functions, life support as well. You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room. </font></p

L107899 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Did you say your planet, sir?
L107900 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ An interesting test of power. Your enormous forces against mine. Who would win?
L107901 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you efrain from a most useless experiment.
L107902 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ Constantinople, summer 1334. It marched through the streets, the sewers. It left the city by ox cart, by sea, to kill half of Europe. The rats, rustling and squealing in the night as they, too, died. The ats.

L107904 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness. A protection against the curious, the uninvited.
L107905 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then you live here alone.

L107907 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem logical to do so for the moment.
L107908 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, ight over Mister Flint if necessary.
L107909 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is the most splendid private collection of art I've eve seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. </font></p
L107910 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice.
L107911 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy.
L107912 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood
L107913 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion.
L107914 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'll drink to that. What emotion?
L107915 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vincis, they would be priceless.
L107916 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Would be? You mean you think they're fakes?
L107917 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.
L107918 +++$+++ u1117 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ RAYNA +++$+++ Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field density and its relationship to gravity phenomena.
L107919 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of mine.
L107920 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand.
L107921 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.
L107922 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Like a hawk.
L107923 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.

L107925 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown.
L107926 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Spock.

L107928 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another. It will now go to the laboratory and join Doctor McCoy.
L107929 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating.
L107930 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I don't like the way he orders her around.
L107931 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science.
L107932 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He loves her?
L107933 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Strongly indicated.
L107934 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance.
L107935 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it.
L107936 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk out, Mister Scott.
L107937 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain iophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the orde of six thousand years.
L107938 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can you confirm that, Mister Spock?
L107939 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship.
L107940 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Time factor.
L107941 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.
L107942 +++$+++ u1211 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK  +++$+++ As though he's keeping us here for some reason.
L107943 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are eing monitored and that he is aware of our every move.
L107944 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No award of custody? </font></p
L107945 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the yetalyn.
L107946 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness. </font></p and so was the ryetalyn.
L107947 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart.
L107948 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, I think we'd better tell Jim.
L107949 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The captain wanted us to wait here. </font></p
L107950 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here.
L107951 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door.
L107952 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it, if we can. Well, let's not disappoint the chess master. Phasers on full.
L107953 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn.
L107954 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why you?
L107955 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There may be dangers within.
L107956 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's find out.
L107957 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Let me go alone, Captain.
L107958 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ Created here by my hand. Here, the centuries of loneliness were to end.
L107959 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings.
L107960 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ I am Brahms.
L107961 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And da Vinci?
L107962 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ Yes.
L107963 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How many other names shall we call you?
L107964 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson. A hundred other names you do not know.
L107965 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You were born?
L107966 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected.
L107967 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history.
L107968 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ Galileo, Socrates, Moses. I have married a hundred times, Captain. Selected, loved, cherished. Caressed a smoothness, inhaled a ief fragrance. Then age, death, the taste of dust. Do you understand?
L107969 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself. Your mate for all time.
L107970 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, you knew?
L107971 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I had hoped I was wrong.
L107972 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why?
L107973 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have discovered what he is, Captain.
L107974 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ If you leave, the curious would follow, the foolish, the meddlers, the officials, the seekers. My privacy was my own. Its invasion be on your head.
L107975 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We can remain silent.
L107976 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ I must.
L107977 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What will you feel for him after we are gone?
L107978 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ FLINT +++$+++ No!
L107979 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances.
L107980 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman.
L107981 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, you're not, for she is not.
L107982 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, shes human. The human spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she wishes.
L107983 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger.
L107984 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What happened?
L107985 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not ear to hurt either of you. The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her.
L107986 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father.

L107987 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered.
L107988 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last.
L107989 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your report, Doctor.
L107990 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally correlated: He's dying. You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality. He'll live the remainder of a normal life span, then die.
L107991 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know?
L107992 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with.
L107993 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Indeed.
L107994 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can. Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier fo you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't written into your book. Goodnight, Spock.
L107995 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Goodnight, Doctor.
L107996 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I do wish he could forget her.
L107997 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Forget. </font> </p
L107998 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, any answers?
L107999 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface, Captain.
L108000 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there.
L108001 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have unde observation.
L108002 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ I'm reading it now, Mister Spock. It seems to indicate artificial power being generated in factor seven quantities.
L108003 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there.
L108004 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet, Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous.
L108005 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some natural phenomena.

L108010 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I was requesting your analysis, Spock.
L108011 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion.

L108017 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like living rock with heavy fore claws. Its settling down now to completely human readings.

L108021 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using you old-style measurements.
L108022 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did.
L108023 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile.

L108030 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there?
L108031 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this.
L108032 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that?
L108033 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear. President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What etter way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive fo you.
L108034 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But not only to me, Spock.
L108035 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work of duplication.
L108036 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock, as for you
L108037 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you.

L108045 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The father of all we became.
L108046 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ENGINEER  +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir.
L108047 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact, extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible.
L108048 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SURAK +++$+++ Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response?
L108049 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true.
L108050 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SURAK +++$+++ The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind, Spock.
L108051 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg forgiveness.
L108052 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight?
L108053 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest.
L108054 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock?
L108055 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack.
L108056 +++$+++ u1250 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GREEN +++$+++ No, it's not advantage enough. I want to make sure the odds are in our favour. Overwhelm and devastate, that's the way to get power and to hold it, and I mean to do that. </font></p all the crewmen aboard.
L108057 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And if theyre real, Captain?
L108058 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang?
L108059 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain.
L108060 +++$+++ u1178 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Indeed I did.
L108061 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course.
L108062 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SURAK +++$+++ I will not harm others, Captain.
L108063 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain.
L108064 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SURAK +++$+++ The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. Afte all, I'm no warrior.
L108065 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let him attempt it.
L108066 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You show emotion, Spock.
L108067 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I deeply respect what he has accomplished.
L108068 +++$+++ u1175 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GREEN  +++$+++ You can't let him suffer.
L108069 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect us to act rashly.
L108070 +++$+++ u1123 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SURAK  +++$+++ Help me, Spock!
L108071 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He was aware of what might happen when he went.
L108072 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I should never have let him go.
L108073 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him.
L108074 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How can you ignore that?
L108075 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A Vulcan would not cry out so.
L108076 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony.
L108077 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am not insensitive to it, Captain.
L108078 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't.
L108079 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting fo us to attempt a rescue.
L108080 +++$+++ u1123 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SURAK  +++$+++ Help me, Spock!
L108081 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir.
L108082 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation?
L108083 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation.
L108084 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well?
L108085 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln afte scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter.
L108086 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel I actually met Lincoln.
L108087 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain. Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be anything but what we expected them to be?

L108095 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Ou eadings indicated that there was no one here at all.

L108132 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ Even your name is strange. Forgive me. I've never seen anyone who looks like you. Why are you here? Are you prisoners too?
L108133 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Prisoners?
L108134 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people when he wants them to disappear. Didn't you come in through the time portal?
L108135 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We were sent here by mistake.
L108136 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from someplace farther than that.
L108137 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home is a planet millions of light years away.
L108138 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ Oh, how wonderful! I've always loved books about such possibilities. But they are only stories. This isn't real. I must be imagining all this. I'm going mad!
L108139 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am substantial. You are not imagining this.
L108140 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library?

L108145 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He's our commanding officer and our friend.
L108146 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ I saw only the two of you. I did not know there was another.
L108147 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is?
L108148 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ But your friend. He is ill.
L108149 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may neve egain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk.
L108150 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ You make it sound like an equation.
L108151 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron. If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask
L108152 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ Why? My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely. Two of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Kahn.
L108153 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zo Kahn the Tyrant.
L108154 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen. Zor Kahn determined to destroy our entire family. He used the atavachron to send us places no one could ever find us.
L108155 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk.
L108156 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ I can't go through the portal again. If I do, I will die.
L108157 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You cannot go back?
L108158 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, I remember you.
L108159 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Come, Doctor, back to bed.
L108160 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim?
L108161 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back.
L108162 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back.
L108163 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die.
L108164 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here?
L108165 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is. Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an evil spirit. From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much chance unless I can get to the prosecutor.
L108166 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach.
L108167 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Really?
L108168 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see.
L108169 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.
L108170 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license. Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor around here.
L108171 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise.
L108172 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I wonder where she is.
L108173 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Five thousand years in the future.
L108174 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I wonder where Jim is.
L108175 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is.
L108176 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it?
L108177 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What was there to do?
L108178 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Locate the portal. It can't be too far.
L108179 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of ehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you?
L108180 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, that was clear to me.
L108181 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back means.
L108182 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I don't believe it, Spock. Its just not like you to give up trying.
L108183 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do you understand?
L108184 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste.
L108185 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.
L108186 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan.
L108187 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure.
L108188 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ What's happening to you, Spock?
L108189 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.

L108191 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time.
L108192 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ It's not that I wish to return. This is my time now. I've had to face that. But it has been lonely here. Do you know what it's like to be alone? Really alone?
L108193 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes. I know what it is like.
L108194 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ I believe you do. Have something to eat, please.
L108195 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If it pleases you. This is animal flesh?
L108196 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid.
L108197 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in the shelter?
L108198 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ There's an underground hot spring.
L108199 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment.
L108200 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ There aren't many luxuries around here. Zor Kahn only left me what was necessary to survive.
L108201 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But he evidently intended that you continue living.
L108202 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ Yes. He gave me weapons, a shelter, food. Everything I needed to live except companionship. He did not want it said that he had me killed. But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is? A very inventive mind, that man.
L108203 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention. I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're eautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so?
L108204 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ ZARABETH +++$+++ I have longed to hear you say it.
L108205 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.
L108206 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We'll both look, Mister Atoz.
L108207 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've given you the facts, Doctor.
L108208 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word because it's what you wanted to believe?
L108209 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make?
L108210 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get ack.
L108211 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She would not jeopardise other lives.
L108212 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead, Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill!
L108213 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What are you doing to her?
L108214 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want? Think. What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those feelings before?
L108215 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan.
L108216 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years. Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very moment?
L108217 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians.
L108218 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born!
L108219 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back?
L108220 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Try again.
L108221 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless.
L108222 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.

L108229 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you.
L108230 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to Enterprise.
L108231 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see, I've returned to the present in every sense.
L108232 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ But it did happen, Spock.
L108233 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago.
L108234 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Janice, you must remain absolutely quiet. Those are doctor's orders, not mine.
L108235 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings. Approximately seven hundred metres from here. Help will have to be immediate.
L108236 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir. Three seven three mark eight.
L108237 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means eversing course.
L108238 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated.
L108239 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to ou destination.
L108240 +++$+++ u1145 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir.
L108241 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her. Their medical facilities are the most primitive.
L108242 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They will have to serve.
L108243 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that not crucial to your decision?
L108244 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present course.
L108245 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency.
L108246 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that inary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise.
L108247 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that ou endezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled.
L108248 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, if youd concentrate on the areas for which you are esponsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already.
L108249 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference.
L108250 +++$+++ u1210 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ CHAPEL +++$+++ Well, I'll be right back. I'm glad you're feeling so much etter.  glass against the bed. Then she uses it to cut the strap holding he down)
L108251 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense.
L108252 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin.
L108253 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears to be primarily mental.
L108254 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult.
L108255 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted.
L108256 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results of specific tests. So far all we have to offer are our opinions.
L108257 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind?
L108258 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary.
L108259 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as these might be misinterpreted.
L108260 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear.
L108261 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester. Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light.
L108262 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GALLOWAY +++$+++ She regained consciousness very quickly.
L108263 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Good. I have questions to ask her.
L108264 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GALLOWAY +++$+++ Did the captain order it, sir?
L108265 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant.
L108266 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GALLOWAY +++$+++ The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Doctor Lester.
L108267 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Has such an order ever included his senior officers?
L108268 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GALLOWAY +++$+++ No, sir. Mister Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard should be present.
L108269 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ By all means, Lieutenant. </font></p
L108270 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Yes, that's what it must've been.
L108271 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy.
L108272 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus Two. I am a living example.
L108273 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests.
L108274 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the <a href="64.htm"> Tholian Sector</a>, you risked your life and the Enterprise to get me ack. Help me get back now. When the <a href="63.htm" Vians of Minara</a> demanded that we let Bones die, we didn't permit it.
L108275 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have een recorded. They could have become known to you.
L108276 +++$+++ u1206 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ JANICE +++$+++ You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe. You know his thoughts. What does your telepathic mind tell you now?
L108277 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence. Evidence must be factual. Doctor McCoy may be of help. Come with me.
L108278 +++$+++ u1092 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ MCCOY +++$+++ There is no positive evidence of any disorder. </font></p
L108279 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He is not the captain.
L108280 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ GALLOWAY +++$+++ You're as mad as she is. You're to leave here at once. I follow orders.
L108281 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty.  him with the other hand)

L108283 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir. No physical resistance will be offered.
L108284 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Surely you must have more than that to go on.
L108285 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk.
L108286 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Your evidence is completely subjective. We have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open.
L108287 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain?
L108288 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence.
L108289 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ She is dangerous only to your authority, sir.
L108290 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away.
L108291 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put the questions.
L108292 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Docto McCoy's findings?
L108293 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I know them now.
L108294 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And what have you to say now?
L108295 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position. So far.
L108296 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do.
L108297 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy. They've been witness to many strange events. They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon.
L108298 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester?
L108299 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not precisely, no.
L108300 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise?
L108301 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I expect only to reveal the truth.
L108302 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up! Return to the Enterprise family. All charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus Two will fade and e forgotten.
L108303 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And what will become of Doctor Lester?
L108304 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a esponsibility I owe her from the past.
L108305 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made. You are not Captain Kirk. You have ruthlessly appropriated his body, ut the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk. You do not elong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.
L108306 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Miste Spock's tirade.
L108307 +++$+++ u1085 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK  +++$+++ You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.
L108308 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you understand the nature of it?
L108309 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do. And I stand by it.
L108310 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Docto McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote.
L108311 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.
L108312 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. Youll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or,
L108313 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps you were.
L108314 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ The bridge is where you belong.
L108315 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack. </font></p
L108316 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells. If theres any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman.
L108317 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ May I point out, Captain
L108318 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I didn't want to destroy her.
L108319 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m617 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm sure we all understand that, Captain.

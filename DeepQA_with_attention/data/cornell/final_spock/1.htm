TYLER: All operating, sir. <br>
SPOCK: It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there,
Captain, headed this way. <br>
TYLER: It could be these meteorites. <br>
ONE: No, it's something else. There's still something out there. <br>
TYLER: It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The
meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.<br>
ONE: Evasive manoeuvres, sir?<br>
PIKE: Steady as we go.<br>
GARISON: It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style
distress signal.<br>
PIKE: They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this
way.<br>
GARISON: A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No
other message.<br>
TYLER: I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.<br>
ONE: We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.<br>
SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.
It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.<br>
TYLER: It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to
here.<br>
SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar
system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class
M, oxygen atmosphere.<br>
ONE: Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years.<br>
PIKE: If they survived the crash.<br>
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?<br>
PIKE: Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega
Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the
helm. Maintain present course.<br>
ONE: Yes, sir.

PIKE: Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I
didn't say there's anything wrong with me.<br>
BOYCE: I understand we picked up a distress signal.<br>
PIKE: That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it
seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to
log the ship's doctor's opinion, too.<br>
BOYCE: Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.<br>
PIKE: Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the
Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also.
What the devil are you putting in there, ice?<br>
BOYCE: Who wants a warm martini?<br>
PIKE: What makes you think I need one?<br>
BOYCE: Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell
his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?<br>
PIKE: Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven
injured.<br>
BOYCE: Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?<br>
PIKE: Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the
armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted
fortress and attacked by one of their warriors.<br>
BOYCE: Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You
treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now
you're tired and you<br>
PIKE: You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for
two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too
risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who
doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil.<br>
BOYCE: To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?<br>
PIKE: To the point of considering resigning.<br>
BOYCE: And do what?<br>
PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles
of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we
used to take some food and ride out all day.<br>
BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.<br>
PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on
Regulus or on the Orion colony.<br>
BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?<br>
PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole
galaxy of things to choose from.<br>
BOYCE: Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets
it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to
wither away.<br>
PIKE: Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.<br>
BOYCE: Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers.
The living and the dying.<br>
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up

hundred now, sir. <br>
PIKE: Oh, I see. Thank you. <br>
ONE: She's replacing your former yeoman, sir. <br>
PIKE: She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used
to having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're
different, of course. <br>
(The Enterprise arrives at a planet) <br>
TYLER: We've settled into orbit, sir.<br>
GEOLOGIST: Geological lab report complete, Captain.<br>
SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.<br>
PIKE: Spectography?<br>
GEOLOGIST: Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy
with inert elements but well within safety limits.<br>
PIKE: Gravity?<br>
GEOLOGIST: Zero point nine of Earth.<br>
TYLER: Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read
it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a
spaceship hull.<br>
PIKE: Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?<br>
SPOCK: Yes, sir.<br>
TYLER: Yes, sir. <br>
PIKE: Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll
have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us.<br>

crashed.<br>

big bald heads) <br>

you very shortly.<br>

specimen.<br>
ONE [OC]: I didn't get that last message, Captain.<br>
PIKE: Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out.<br>
HASKINS: You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her
whole life with a collection of aging scientists.<br>
BOYCE: If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical
report.<br>
VINA: I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.<br>
BOYCE: Their health is excellent. Almost too good.<br>
HASKINS: There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt
if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll
accept your judgment.<br>
(Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face) <br>
VINA: You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon.
Don't you see it? Here and here.<br>
PIKE: I don't understand.<br>
VINA: You will. You're a perfect choice. <br>

door opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At
the settlement -)<br>
TYLER: Captain! <br>
(Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They
fire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to
show the metal underneath.) <br>
SPOCK: Spock here.<br>
ONE [OC]: Landing party, come in.<br>
SPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some
sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a
transparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and
notices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant
bird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive)<br>
PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the
space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this
galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?<br>
(the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices)<br>
TALOSIAN: It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen
is shockingly limited.<br>
MAGISTRATE: This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so
easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is
only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a
simple illusion we placed in their minds.<br>
PIKE: You're not speaking, yet I can hear you.<br>
MAGISTRATE: You will note the confusion as it reads our thought
transmissions.<br>
PIKE: All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read
yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an
unfriendly act<br>
MAGISTRATE: You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The
specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel,
and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess,
the creature will throw himself against the transparency.<br>
PIKE: If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these
walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.<br>
MAGISTRATE: Despite its frustration, the creature appears more
adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the
experiment. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live
deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down
there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more
vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.<br>
ONE: So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock.<br>
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's
inhabitants.<br>
BOYCE: It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we
wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery,
everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,
the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the
danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They
can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and
experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real
and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.<br>
ONE: Any estimate what they might want one of us for? <br>
SPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth
people are put together. Or it could be something more. <br>
TYLER: Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up
against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it.
Enough to blast half a continent. <br>
SPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing
about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great
they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.<br>
TYLER: It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably
needs it fast. <br>ONE: Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.
We'll try blasting through that metal.

VINA: Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.<br>
PIKE: But it's only a dream.<br>
VINA: You have to kill him as you did here before.<br>
PIKE: You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an
animal performing for its supper.<br>
VINA: It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what
matters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please,
don't you know what he'll do to us? <br>

and they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the

PIKE: What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?<br>
VINA: I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish,
be anything you wish.<br>
PIKE: So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how
I react, is that it?<br>
VINA: Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?<br>
PIKE: Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?<br>
VINA: You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any
woman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole
universe. Let me please you.<br>
PIKE: Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there
any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts
against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?<br>

VINA: War, thousands of centuries ago.<br>
PIKE: That's why it's so barren up there?<br>
VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.<br>
PIKE: So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and
they concentrated on developing their mental power.<br>
VINA: But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams
become more important than reality, you give up travel, building,
creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by
your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left
behind in the thought record.<br>
PIKE: Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.<br>
VINA: You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion
for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole
collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from
all over this part of the galaxy.<br>

consume the nourishment.<br>

planet, but with only a single survivor.<br>

was to get my hands around your neck.<br>

interesting.<br>
PIKE: Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?<br>
MAGISTRATE: It became necessary to attract a mate.<br>

going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel
protective.<br>

PIKE: It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and
like her.<br>
MAGISTRATE: We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.<br>
PIKE: Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her? So
I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary
only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human
community.<br>

Why don't you punish me?<br>

VINA: My, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? <br>
PIKE: It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the

what we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations.
No responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's
answer. <br>

PIKE; I can't help either one of us if you won't give me a chance. Now,
you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic. They couldn't
repair the machines left by their ancestors. Is that why they want us,
to build a colony of slaves?<br>
VINA: Stop it. Don't you care what they'll do to us?<br>
PIKE: Back in my cage, it seemed for a couple of minutes that our
keeper couldn't read my thoughts. Do emotions like hate, keeping hate
in your mind, does that block off our mind from them?<br>
VINA: Yes. They can't read through primitive emotions. But you can't
keep it up for long enough. I've tried. They keep at you and at you
year after year, tricking and punishing, and they won. They own me. I
know you must hate me for that.<br>
PIKE: Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like.<br>
VINA: But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my
feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they
picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the
same way.<br>
PIKE: If they can read my mind, then they know I'm attracted to you. </font></p>

I saw you in the survivor's camp. <br>
TALOSIAN: A curious species. They have fantasies they hide even from
themselves. <br>
VINA [on monitor]: I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for
you. You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel. That's not new to you,
either. A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do. Yes, a
ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and
proper. You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.

PIKE: Vina?
ORION: Glistening green. Almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain
might have. <br>
OFFICER: Funny how they are on this planet. They actually like being
taken advantage of. Suppose you had all of space to choose from, and
this was only one small sample. <br>

can't make a signal. What is it?<br>

their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black
out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.<br>

can that help?<br>
COLT: Leave him alone.<br>
VINA: He doesn't need you. He's already picked me.<br>
COLT: Picked her? For what? I don't understand.<br>
VINA: Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.<br>
COLT: Offspring, as in children?<br>
ONE: Offspring as in he's Adam. Is that it?<br>
VINA: You're no better choice. They'd have more luck crossing him with
a computer.<br>
ONE: Well, shall we do a little time computation? There was a Vina
listed on that expedition as an adult crewman. Now, adding eighteen
years to your age then.<br>
(The Magistrate approaches the cell)<br>
VINA: It's not fair. I did what you asked.<br>
MAGISTRATE: Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a
selection.<br>
PIKE: I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you. Is your blood
red like ours? I'm going to find out.<br>
MAGISTRATE: Each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour.
The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce
highly intelligent children. Although she seems to lack emotion, this
is largely a pretence. She has often has fantasies involving you. <br>
PIKE: All I want to do is get my hands on you. Can you read these
thoughts? Images of hate, killing?<br>
MAGISTRATE: The other new arrival has considered you unreachable but
now is realising this has changed. The factors in her favour are youth
and strength, plus unusually strong female drives. <br>
PIKE: You'll find my thoughts more interesting. Thoughts so primitive
you can't understand. Emotions so ugly
(stricken by pain)<br>
MAGISTRATE: Wrong thinking is punishable. Right thinking will be as
quickly rewarded. You will find it an effective combination. <br>
(Magistrate leaves)<br>
ONE: Captain.<br>
PIKE: No. No, don't help me. I have to concentrate. They can't read
through hate.

at all. <br>

pistols, firing them at the glass wall. Then he puts one to the
Magistrate's head) <br>

created an illusion this laser is empty. I think it just blasted a hole

evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans, technicians <br>

ship is all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.<br>

ONE: It's wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves.<br>

PIKE: The weapon is building up an overload. A force chamber explosion.
You still have time to get underground. Well, go on! (pushes Vina away)
Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.<br>
VINA: If, if you all think it's this important, then I can't go either.
I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again. <br>

TALOSIAN: Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much
time. Are you prepared to assimilate it?<br>

MAGISTRATE: We had not believed this possible. The customs and history
of your race show a unique hatred of captivity. Even when it's pleasant
and benevolent, you prefer death. This makes you too violent and
dangerous a species for our needs.<br>

ship.<br>

all of us.<br>

eventual death. Is this not sufficient?<br>

last hope.<br>

itself too.<br>

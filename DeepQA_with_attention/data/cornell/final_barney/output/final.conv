Narrator: What was I doing? Your Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life, and me-I'm calling your Uncle, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney:  hey, so you know how I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls? Well, now I've got a new favorite: Lebanese girls! Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.
Ted: Hey, you wanna do something tonight?  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes, and Suit up!
Ted: Hey.  +++$+++  Barney: Where's your suit!? Just once when I say suit up, I wish you'd put on a suit.
Ted: I did that one time.  +++$+++  Barney: It was a blazer!
Ted: You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call "Uncle Ted".  +++$+++  Barney: I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?
Barney: I see what this is about. Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, I'm going to teach you how to live.  Barney, we met at the urinal.
Ted: Oh, right. Hi.  +++$+++  Barney: Lesson one, lose the goatee. It doesn't look good with your suit.
Ted: I'm not wearing a suit.  +++$+++  Barney: Lesson two, get a suit. Suits are cool.  Exhibit A.  Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're... thirty.
Ted: Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.  +++$+++  Barney: I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend.
Ted: You're my best friend, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... "Have you met Ted?"
Ted: Wai-no, no, no. We're not playing "Have You Met Ted?"  +++$+++  Barney:  Hi, have you met Ted? .
Ted: Why am I freaking out all of a sudden? This is crazy! I'm not ready to settle down.  +++$+++  Barney:  how does Carl land a Lebanese girl?
Ted: It's always been "don't even think about it till you're thirty"  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!
Ted: Hey Barney, see that girl?  +++$+++  Barney:  Hey, have you met Ted?
Robin:  Yeah,  What the hell  JERK!  that was fun.  +++$+++  Barney:  De-wait for it-nied! Denied!
Ted: We're going out tomorrow night.  +++$+++  Barney: I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night?
Lily: Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.  +++$+++  Barney:  Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I killed you Connor; don't make me get your mom!
Ted: Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP!
Ted: So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?  +++$+++  Barney: I can't believe you're still not wearing a SUIT!
Ted: She didn't even give me the signal.  +++$+++  Barney: What is she goanna-is she goanna bat her eyes at you in Morse code ?? Ted  Kiss me-No, you just kiss her!
Ted: Not if you don't get the signal.  +++$+++  Barney: Ee- Did Marshall give me the signal?
Marshall: No!  I didn't, I swear.  +++$+++  Barney: But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her.
Ted: Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?  +++$+++  Barney: A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words: you will never see that one again.
Ted: I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two?
Ted:...Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Alright, but under one condition.
Barney: Alright, but under one condition.  +++$+++  Barney:  look at you, you beautiful b*st*rd, you suited up! This is totally going in my blog!
Ted:  Okay. Moment of truth. Wish me luck.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted's goanna get it on with a TV reporter  This just in. Okay
Ted: Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story.  +++$+++  Barney: Why does he get to be the best man?  I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND!
Marshall: Go back in there!  +++$+++  Barney: You're wearing a suit!
Marshall: He's in.  +++$+++  Barney: So,  Ranjit... you must've done it with a Lebanese girl.
Ranjit: Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.  +++$+++  Barney: The women hot there?
Ranjit: Here's a picture of my wife!  +++$+++  Barney:  Simple no would have sufficed.  She's lovely.
Ted:  Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney: So, Marshall. This "Olive Theory" based on you and Lily?
Marshall: Yeah...  +++$+++  Barney: You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them.
Marshall: Yeah, hate olives.  +++$+++  Barney: Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?
Marshall:  You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.  +++$+++  Barney: I swear.
Marshall: On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, "Sure... I hate olives."  +++$+++  Barney: But you like olives!
Marshall: Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married.
Robin: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it.
Ted: Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me?  +++$+++  Barney: Why are we still sitting here? Let's go! We can still make last call. What do you say Lil?  Yo, ho ho and a bottle o' rum?  'Cuz you're a pirate...
Marshall: It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?  +++$+++  Barney: You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?
Marshall: Doggie style.  +++$+++  Barney: I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever-
Lily: Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking.  +++$+++  Barney: Hit it Ranjit.
Lily: That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her!  +++$+++  Barney: There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal.
Ted: Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore.
Ted: Not how much? What.  +++$+++  Barney: The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.
Ted: No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.  +++$+++  Barney: Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal.
Lily: Oh, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry, Native American.
Ted: Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.  +++$+++  Barney: Canceling out Barney.
Ted: I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.  +++$+++  Barney: Excuse me, guys. Coming through.
Ted: Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, hi guys.
Ted: What are you doing here?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, just the Lord's work.
Ted: But you're Satan.  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.
Kendall: Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm on it.
Kendall: Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer  +++$+++  Barney: That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.
Robin: Come on, we just wanna help out.  +++$+++  Barney: Kendall, they're cool.
Kendall: Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.
Marshall: Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!  +++$+++  Barney: Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.
Ted: Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?  +++$+++  Barney:  You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.
Marshall: Lily!  +++$+++  Barney: So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.
Kendall: Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, Right. Thanks.
Ted: Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, what's up?
Ted: You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, so.
Ted: All right, let me see that.  +++$+++  Barney: That's my private personal business!
Ted: Court-mandated community service.  +++$+++  Barney: That's my private personal business.
Barney: That's my private personal business.  +++$+++  Barney: I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.
Ted: You peed on a church?  +++$+++  Barney: I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.
Robin: Now, all's right with the world again.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.
Barney: OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.  +++$+++  Barney: When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?
Robin: Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.
Barney: I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.  +++$+++  Barney: Volunteer of the year!
Ted: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, I'm glad you asked.
Robin: Surprisingly good.  +++$+++  Barney: Right? I told you so.
Ted: You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.
Ted: Are you joking?  +++$+++  Barney: I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.
Walter: No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.
Ted: Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.  +++$+++  Barney: No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.
Robin: And why is that girl checking you out?  +++$+++  Barney: Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged
Ted: Yeah, so?  +++$+++  Barney: So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?
Ted: Dammit Past Ted  +++$+++  Barney: You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.
Ted: One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.  +++$+++  Barney: Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.
Robin: Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?  +++$+++  Barney: Sort of on a date with her.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.
Robin: Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.
Robin: Ooh, can I do it?  +++$+++  Barney: Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.
Barney: Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.  +++$+++  Barney: Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?
Robin: Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.  +++$+++  Barney: An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.
Barney: An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?
Robin: Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.
Barney: Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.  +++$+++  Barney: See you guys later.
Ted: They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.  +++$+++  Barney: Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.
Robin: One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.  +++$+++  Barney: Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.
Ted: Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?  +++$+++  Barney: You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.
Ted: What, like buy a new sofa?  +++$+++  Barney: Bigger.
Barney: Bigger.  +++$+++  Barney: Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.
Robin: A lemon law, like for cars.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.
Barney: Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi Katie. Barney.
Katie: Hi, it's good to finally meet you.  +++$+++  Barney: Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.
Barney: Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.  +++$+++  Barney : Tell your friends.
Barney : Tell your friends.  +++$+++  Barney : It's gonna be a thing.
Girl #2: You're a jerk.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!
Robin: For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.  +++$+++  Barney: No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.
Robin: It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.
Barney: OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.  +++$+++  Barney: You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?
Robin: Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.  +++$+++  Barney: Bad move, Scherbatsky.
Barney: Bad move, Scherbatsky.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, have you met Robin?
Robin: Hello.  +++$+++  Barney:  Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.
Robin: Leave me alone.  +++$+++  Barney: 4:56, 4:57, 4:58.
Robin: We're only just getting to know each other.  +++$+++  Barney: Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.
Marshall: They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.  +++$+++  Barney: So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.
Barney: So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.  +++$+++  Barney: What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.
Barney: What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.
Jackie: Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.  +++$+++  Barney: It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.
Everyone: Here here. Cheers  +++$+++  Barney: And to the lemon law.
Barney: And to the lemon law.  +++$+++  Barney: Self-clink.
Lily: I know, I'm still shaking.  +++$+++  Barney: What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.
Lily: But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
Marshall: It, it was a mouse.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.
Robin: Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...  +++$+++  Barney: Was that chick at the end really a client?
Robin: Yes.  +++$+++  Barney: We're signing up.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.
Lily: Oh my God.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on.
Barney: Come on.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: My boat is sinking.
Ted: Your boat is sinking. That was good.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again.
Ellen: All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.  +++$+++  Barney: Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless s*x.
Ellen: You deserve more.  +++$+++  Barney: That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.
Ellen: Oh, of course you can. That is so...  +++$+++  Barney: It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?
Ellen: Get out.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Ellen: I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh my God, people do that.
Ellen: You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?  +++$+++  Barney: What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?
Ellen: That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, Ted, let's go.
Ellen: You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.  +++$+++  Barney : It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.'
Lily: OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.
Marshall: Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.  +++$+++  Barney: So did you get a good look at it?
Lily: It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...  +++$+++  Barney: Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?
Ted: Did you just use my name as a verb?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when
Ted: My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.
Ted: OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.  +++$+++  Barney: You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.
Lily: Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.
Sarah : Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day.  +++$+++  Barney: The doctor will see you now.
Ted: Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.  +++$+++  Barney:  Happy ending.
Ted: Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot.  +++$+++  Barney: All right, see you later. Happy hunting.
Lily: Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.
Marshall: Tarzan nipple blue.  +++$+++  Barney: You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse...
Lily ): Wow, we get it.  +++$+++  Barney: She's a slutty nurse.
Robin: We're not really ready to go public yet.  +++$+++  Barney : Married.
Ted: And she...  +++$+++  Barney: And she called it the Tootsie Roll.
Ted: Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.  +++$+++  Barney: You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.
Marshall: It's an elaborate costume.  +++$+++  Barney: No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!
Ted: No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.
Ted: We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.  +++$+++  Barney: Hm,  Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or  Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.
Ted: I'm heading up to the roof.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice.  We out.
Marshall : I think we got them beat.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't believe you talked me into this.
Ted: I didn't. You followed me up here.  +++$+++  Barney: This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.
Barney: This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.  +++$+++  Barney: There are six chicks here.
Shagarats:  My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lives over the ocean. Oh bring back my bonnie to me...  +++$+++  Barney : What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?
Lily: Arr-gyle.  +++$+++  Barney : And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant?
Lily: Arrr-by's  +++$+++  Barney : Would think it would be Arby's,  but actually it's Long John Silver's.
Lily: Really tasty.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey.
Hula Girl: Hey.  +++$+++  Barney: So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah.
Hula Girl: Right, cuz I'm wearing a lei.  +++$+++  Barney: It isn't funny if you explain the joke.
Barney: It isn't funny if you explain the joke.  +++$+++  Barney: Let's bail.
Ted: Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.  +++$+++  Barney: Name one person you know at this party.
Ted: Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?  +++$+++  Barney: OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle.
Ted: Really? That's the nickname now?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, the Barnacle.
Ted: The Barnacle.  +++$+++  Barney: That's it. Barnacle out.
Ted: Barney. What, you're back?  +++$+++  Barney: That's right.
Ted: In a totally new costume.  +++$+++  Barney: Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.
Barney: Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.  +++$+++  Barney: What's with the face?
Ted: It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.  +++$+++  Barney: So go to the bathroom.
Ted: No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.  +++$+++  Barney: So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.
Angel Guy: Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there.
Robin: Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.  +++$+++  Barney: Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.
Hula Girl: You wouldn't believe.  +++$+++  Barney: I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink.
Hula Girl: You certainly are a charming devil.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm also a horny devil.  Yeah.
Hula Girl: No.  +++$+++  Barney : Oh, go to hell.
Robin: Brain freeze.  +++$+++  Barney: OK Victoria's Secret party right now.
Ted: Nope.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.
Ted: She might.  +++$+++  Barney: Oy.
Ted: Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!
Ted:  See ya.  +++$+++  Barney: No, see ya. ) Ow.
Ted: Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...  +++$+++  Barney: You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.
Ted: Unbelievable.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, it is.
Hula Girl: Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy.  +++$+++  Barney: What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot
Hula Girl: I cannot believe I gave you my number  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, well, you did, thanks.
Hula girl: Well, give it back.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.
Hula Girl: But I'm never gonna go out with you.  +++$+++  Barney: But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.
Ted: Nice.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.
Ted: I'm staying.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine. Fine.
Ted: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm flippering you off.
Robin: Because tonight, I am getting us all into "Okay".  +++$+++  Barney: "Okay"!? Awesome!!
Ted: What's going on, did I just have a stroke?  +++$+++  Barney: "Okay" is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in.
Ted: A friend of yours named you?  +++$+++  Barney: No... a friend of mine named, shut up.
Robin: He's even getting me into the VIP room.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean...
Robin: Okay, what does "VIP" stand for in your universe?  +++$+++  Barney:... I know that the "P" is pen1s.
Ted: Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...  +++$+++  Barney: All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from.
Robin: Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.  +++$+++  Barney: Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.
Ted: Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.  +++$+++  Barney: So, do you have any other hot single fr...
Ted: Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney:  And his hair was perfect.
Lily: Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours.  +++$+++  Barney: One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?
Marshall: Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.  +++$+++  Barney: What the hell happened to these two?
Marshall: Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses...  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay.
Ted: Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up.  +++$+++  Barney: My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she's mine.
Ted: Do strategies ever work for you?  +++$+++  Barney: Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's "about half the time".
Ted: Whoa... this place in lourd!  +++$+++  Barney: You think?
Barney: You think?  +++$+++  Barney:  Okay, it's a little loud.
Ted:  I'm bailing, see ya.  +++$+++  Barney:  Oh hey, I can't see her face. Is she hot?
Marshall:...any aspirin?  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe theres...
Barney: Maybe theres...  +++$+++  Barney: a machine in...
Barney: a machine in...  +++$+++  Barney: The restroom.
Ted:  Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, bring your coat, we're leaving.
Ted: What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?  +++$+++  Barney: That was my cousin, Leslie.
Ted:  What?!  +++$+++  Barney: No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, "Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise
Ted:  Alright, I promise. Let's get Marshall and go, okay.  Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so...
Ted: Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night...  +++$+++  Barney: FINE! Just... eh.
Narrator: So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth. It was nice, and then it got icky.  +++$+++  Barney, Ted and Robin:  Eww.
Ted: I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...  +++$+++  Barney: THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT.
Marshall: I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY.  +++$+++  Barney: WHAT?
Ted: PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.  +++$+++  Barney: WHAT?
Marshall: YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY...  +++$+++  Barney: THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!
Ted: That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.  +++$+++  Barney: Booger.
Robin: Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.  +++$+++  Barney: Not some stupid word, "Booger".
Robin: But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist.  +++$+++  Barney: What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper.
Robin: So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying "Booger" for fifty bucks.  +++$+++  Barney: Of course not, because now you're saying "Nipple" and it's a hundred!  Step into my web.
Ted:  Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?  +++$+++  Barney: Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants.
Ted: I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?  +++$+++  Barney: You dumped a p0rn star? Friendship over  FRIENDSHIP OVER!
Lily: At least it's better than booger.  Booger.  +++$+++  Barney: There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge...
Robin: No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee.
Lily: Seriously, who talks like that?  +++$+++  Barney: Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this
Ted: I don't know!  +++$+++  Barney: Did you sleep with her sister?
Ted: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Sleep with her mom?
Ted: No.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm losing interest in your story.
Lily:  Hi, Marshall, it's Lily. We're not going have s*x for at least a month. But you're awesome. Okay bye-bye.  +++$+++  Barney: Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should've done it in person.
Lily: Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney: Desperate "Please-don't-leave-me" s*x is amazing.
Ted: That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right.  +++$+++  Barney: You know what else? My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic.
Ted: I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?  +++$+++  Barney: You know, that Natalie... she's good times.
Marshall: Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it?  +++$+++  Barney: She's probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done!
Marshall: No, no. We're going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... "It's not you it's me"?  +++$+++  Barney: Mm... Mm! Six words! You... look... fat... in... those... jeans..., you're free to go.
Lily: Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?  +++$+++  Barney: Seriously, honey, men are working, here.
Robin: Want to talk mature? I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs.  +++$+++  Barney: And great TV was had by all. Alright Scherbatsky, new challenge. And this one's big. But so, is the cash reward. For one thousand dollars, you heard me, all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these...
All: The Ickey Shuffle.  +++$+++  Barney: And as you do it, you say this, "Elbert Ickey Woods. The bangles were fools to cut you in '91. Your 1521 rushing yards and your 27 touch downs will not be forgotten. So Coach Dave Shullah, screw you and your crappy steakhouse."
Narrator: Right, so  back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, "Maybe I should get married." Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in.  +++$+++  Barney: I suggest we play a little game I like to call, "Have you Met Ted?"
Ted: No, no, no-we're not playing "Have you Met Ted!"  +++$+++  Barney:  Hi! Have you met Ted?
Ted: I'm in love with her.  +++$+++  Barney:  No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.
Ted: We are now-Casual  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, cuz nothing says "Casual" like inviting a hundred people over just to "Mac" on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.
Ted: Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.  +++$+++  Barney: What's so special about the roof?
Marshall: We do it up there sometimes.  +++$+++  Barney: Solid plan, my little friend.
Ted: We're the same height.  +++$+++  Barney: But may I suggest one little modification.
Barney: But may I suggest one little modification.  +++$+++  Barney: That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have s*x with her! Crazy monkey-style.
Ted: That's not the plan.  +++$+++  Barney: Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!
Ted: Yeah, but she's not Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?
Ted: Barney, I don't wanna say-  +++$+++  Barney: Aargh!  Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!
Lily: Man you're a dork.  +++$+++  Barney: beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call "Have You Met Ted?"
Ted: No, come on not this.  +++$+++  Barney:  Hi! Have you met Ted?
Tatiana: Hi.  +++$+++  Barney: Do you know Marshall? Lily?
Tatiana: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Hmm, do you know anyone at this party?
Tatiana: I work with Carlos.  +++$+++  Barney: Excuse me,  Anyone know a Carlos?
Lily: No.  +++$+++  Barney: On a silver platter! Bon appetite!
Ted: I don't think so.  +++$+++  Barney: Your loss, her gain.  Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!
Ted: Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, Robin's not coming.
Lily: I'm the luckiest girl alive  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?
Ted: I have no idea who that is.  +++$+++  Barney: She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?
Ted: I don't know any Carlos.  +++$+++  Barney: Grr.  Hi, you. You're back.
Tatiana: I sure am . Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.  +++$+++  Barney: "sweetie"? Really?  Sweetie?
Marshall: Alright.  +++$+++  Barney: So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl.
Ted: Oh, that was fast.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?
Barney: Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?  +++$+++  Barney: I think I'm in love with you.
Tatiana: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Thanks, bro
Narrator: So I threw a third party for Robin. On a Sunday night  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, this is lame.
Ted: lame or "Casual"?  +++$+++  Barney: lame.
Tatiana: Hello, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Of course.
Tatiana: You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?  +++$+++  Barney: Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!
Tatiana: I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you.  +++$+++  Barney: Who is Carlos!?
Carlos: Carlos  +++$+++  Barney and Ted: Ohhh.
Ted: She's not just "one of them" she's the one.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah well, "the one" is heading up to "the roof".
Ted: My friends are goanna love you-like you-you know, as a friend.  Jackass.  +++$+++  Barney: Unbelievable. That is just a recipe for disaster, they work together
Ted: You jealous?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don't?
Mashall, Lily and Ted: Ohh!!  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not sure I like her.
Ted: What's wrong with MacLaren's?  +++$+++  Barney:  MacLaren's is bore, snore. Ted, tonight we're going to go out. We're going to meet some ladies. It's going to be legendary. Phone-five!
Narrator: I had no idea why I hung out with Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: You didn't phone-five did you? I know when you don't phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren's.
Ted: Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...  +++$+++  Barney: MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun.
Ted: See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!  +++$+++  Barney: This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?
Ted: No it doesn't.  +++$+++  Barney: Get in the cab. Marshall you too.
Marshall: Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi...  +++$+++  Barney: I understand.  Get in the cab.
Ted: Why can Marshall say no?  +++$+++  Barney: Uhh... because he's getting laid.
Marshall: Consistently.  +++$+++  Barney:  Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here. You keep going to the same bar, you're in a rut and I am a rut buster. I'm going to bust your rut .
Ted: It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, what's the first syllable in rutting  Peace out, suckers.
Ted: Alright, so what's this legendary plan.  +++$+++  Barney: First we got to pick someone up at the airport.
Ted: Okay, I'm outta here.  +++$+++  Barney:  Estaban, doors!
Barney:  Estaban, doors!  +++$+++  Barney: Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours.
Ted: Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know. Maybe her? Or her.
Ted: Wait so when you said you were going to "pick someone up at the airport". You meant you were going to "pick someone up at the airport".  +++$+++  Barney:  Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, "You have a wheelie bag? Wh... I have a wheelie bag!"
Ted: You've gotta be kidding me.  +++$+++  Barney: False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.
Ted: I'm sketchy?  +++$+++  Barney: Trust me, it's going to be legendary.
Ted: Don't say "legendary", okay? You're too liberal with the word legendary.  +++$+++  Barney: We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up!
Barney: We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move.  Ted, since the dawn of time mankind has struggled...
Ted:  So...uh, did you just get in from Detroit?  Japan.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge. Cute girls are not from Buffalo. Time-out. Ten o'clock. You ready to rock this, Tedder?
Ted: Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we...  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, you klutzy, great guy, you!  Hey, Barney.
Laura: Philadelphia.  +++$+++  Barney: Philly? That's where we're headed!
Laura: You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, you will.  Follow them, tickets on me.
Marshall:  That is awesome.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, is that Marshall?  Marshall, stop whatever you're doing, get in that hoopty-ass Vierro of yours and come meet us in Philly. It's going to be legendary.
Marshall:  Man, I wish I could, guys, but...  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, yeah, yeah... I sent you some pictures on my phone, check it.  Philly!  Admit it, you're having fun. This much fun. Thirty-five thousand feet of fun!
Ted: Well I didn't think we'd be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I'll give you that.  +++$+++  Barney: Let's go talk to those girls.
Ted: Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It's time to unclick.
Fight Attendant:  Sir, seatbelt light's on.  +++$+++  Barney:  Yeah, sorry, sorry.
Marshall:  Fine!  +++$+++  Barney:  No! No! The night is just started. Look, airport bar. Flight attendants! They'll get your tray table at its full upright position. Say what?
Ted: Barney, I am going to kill you.  +++$+++  Barney: Don't say you're going to kill someone in front of airport security, not cool.  Not cool.
Barney: Don't say you're going to kill someone in front of airport security, not cool.  Not cool.  +++$+++  Barney: This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately.
Officer McNeil: We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash.  +++$+++  Barney:  Those bags were your responsibility.
Ted: Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.  +++$+++  Barney:  Please.  We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.
Officer McNeil: Can't remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months.  +++$+++  Barney: Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked.
Ted: Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!  +++$+++  Barney: We are international businessmen...
Officer McNeil: Sir! Lower your voice or we'll restrain you.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, seriously, relax.
Ted: We at least get to call our lawyer.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly!  We have a lawyer?
Ted: Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.
Barney: Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.
Ted: Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, it's a simile.
Robin: Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.  +++$+++  Barney: Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.
Ted: I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck  +++$+++  Barney: What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.
Lily: Ah, here we go.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Lily: A little girl?  +++$+++  Barney: What up?
Lily: Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.  +++$+++  Barney: Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.
Ted: Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?  +++$+++  Barney: Invigorating, thanks.
Ted: I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.  +++$+++  Barney: But to be fair, she's also hot.
Ted: I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, right.
Ted: I did.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?
Ted: Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.  +++$+++  Barney: Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...
Ted, Marshall: A little Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: A little Barney. And you know what he said?  "Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney."
Ted: Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.
Barney: Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.
Claudia: You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.  +++$+++  Barney: Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?
Barney: Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?  +++$+++  Barney:  They all drink vodka cranberries.
Barney:  They all drink vodka cranberries.  +++$+++  Barney: So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?
Claudia: You got $400,000?  +++$+++  Barney: No, but I do have a hug.
Barney: No, but I do have a hug.  +++$+++  Barney:  Thank you.
Claudia: Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man.  +++$+++  Barney: That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.
Barney: That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.  +++$+++  Barney: Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.
Claudia: Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.  +++$+++  Barney: Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.
Lily: Oh, hell no.  +++$+++  Barney: Oww
Lily: Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.
Barney: Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.  +++$+++  Barney: All right, all right.
Robin: Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.  +++$+++  Barney: Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.
Ted: What's a sixteen?  +++$+++  Barney: Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.
Ted: Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.  +++$+++  Barney: Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.
Ted: I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.  +++$+++  Barney: Being single's the best.
Ted: Stay out as late as you want.  +++$+++  Barney: Answer to no one.
Ted: The whole world full of endless possibilities.  +++$+++  Barney: Never having to go to a farmer's market.
Barney: Never having to go to a farmer's market.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...
Lily: Burn!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, the only reason to wait a month for s*x is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.
Robin: Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.  +++$+++  Barney: Really?
Marshall: Good, cause this thing's empty.  +++$+++  Barney: Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say "wow."
Robin: Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.  +++$+++  Barney: It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.
Robin: Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?  +++$+++  Barney: You can't just... Wow!
Robin: Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.  +++$+++  Barney: Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a "bro" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?
Lily: Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.  +++$+++  Barney: You suited up!
Robin: Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.  +++$+++  Barney: Emilio? The woman will have...
Robin: I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. "The Torpedo." Or, as the rollers call it, "Piramide."
Robin: My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.  +++$+++  Barney: Father issues. Hot.
Robin: I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.  +++$+++  Barney: Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.
Robin: Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have s*x to get pregnant.  +++$+++  Barney: What up! Freeze frame high five!
Robin: So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?  +++$+++  Barney: Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...
Robin: What?  +++$+++  Barney: There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.
Robin: Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.
Robin: Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?
Robin: Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.  +++$+++  Barney: No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.
Robin: But I...  +++$+++  Barney: Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.
Robin: See you on the other side.  +++$+++  Barney: Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?
Robin: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: All right.
Robin: Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.  +++$+++  Barney: Neither have I. Of course I cheat.
Robin: Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.
Robin: Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.
Robin: That's a woman.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my mistake. Or is it?
Robin: Let's just focus on your target.  +++$+++  Barney: Right.
Marshall: You always do.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey.
Robin: Hey.  +++$+++  Barney: Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.
Robin: What happened?  +++$+++  Barney: Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.
Robin: But why?  +++$+++  Barney: Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.
Robin: Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?  +++$+++  Barney: Hit!
Marshall: I love you, Lily.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.
Robin: Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.  +++$+++  Barney: Hard-core? That's the only way I play. 
Robin: I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?
Robin: No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.
Robin: What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.  +++$+++  Barney: You invited me up to your apartment to "play Battleship." Is that not an internationally recognized term for s*x?
Robin: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.
Robin: Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...  +++$+++  Barney: But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.
Robin: Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?  +++$+++  Barney: I checked with Ted.
Barney: I checked with Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?
Ted: Sure. Good luck with that.  +++$+++  Barney: Totally gave us his blessing.
Robin: Really?  +++$+++  Barney: Really.
Robin: So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?  +++$+++  Barney: Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...
Robin: What?  +++$+++  Barney: You like Ted.
Robin: I didn't say I liked Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.
Robin: Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?
Robin: You're not gonna tell him, are you?  +++$+++  Barney: No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.
Robin: A-7.  +++$+++  Barney: Miss.
Ted: Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...  +++$+++  Barney: Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.
Marshall: Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.  +++$+++  Barney: So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?
Lily: Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?  +++$+++  Barney: Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.
Lily: Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...  +++$+++  Barney: Where's the tape?
Lily: Fine. I'll go get it.  +++$+++  Barney: Cool, okay. You know, whenever.
Robin: Oh, slut alert!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.
Lily: Barney, what was on that tape?  +++$+++  Barney: Too bad you'll never find out.
Lily: Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.  +++$+++  Barney: What?!
Lily: Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?  +++$+++  Barney: Give it to me, give it, give me...
Ted: Play the tape, play it, play it!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...
Ted: Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, guys, what up?
All: Come on. Stay!  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Marshall: Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.
Lily: The kids still call him Funny Butt.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.
Barney: Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.  +++$+++  Barney: It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right.
Shannon: I love your singing, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: And I love you, Shannon.
Shannon: Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.  +++$+++  Barney: I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.
Man: Hey, nonfat latte to go.  +++$+++  Barney: Mellow order, bro, mellow order.
Man: Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry, I only give high twos.
Man: Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.  +++$+++  Barney: Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.
Man: Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.  +++$+++  Barney: I feel sorry for you, man.
Man: Peace out, hombre.  +++$+++  Barney: Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.
Ted: So, what happened next?  +++$+++  Barney: You know what? This was a mistake.
Robin: I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.  +++$+++  Barney: Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!
Ted: Wow, wow!  +++$+++  Barney: Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.
Barney: Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.  +++$+++  Barney: I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.
Shannon: Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Sugar Bear, where were you?
Shannon: Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.  +++$+++  Barney: But the Nicaraguans need us!
Shannon: It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me.  +++$+++  Barney: Shannon, there is no...
Shannon: Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.  +++$+++  Barney: As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.
Ted: Oh, my God. What happened next?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know, guys.
Marshall: Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.  +++$+++  Barney: Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.
Barney: Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.  +++$+++  Barney: How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!
Shannon: Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.  +++$+++  Barney: We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?
Shannon: Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.  +++$+++  Barney: But I love you.
Shannon: But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.  +++$+++  Barney: I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!
Shannon: I'm just picking up my last paycheck.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?
Man: Oh, she got the tape.  +++$+++  Barney: You? It was you?
Lily: Oh, you poor thing.  +++$+++  Barney: The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.
Lily: You've got to tell us.  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.
Ted: Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?
Ted: And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes! Do it!
Victoria: Yeah. It kind of is.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.
Marshall: Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.
Barney: Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi.
Shannon: Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, Shannon.
Shannon: What are you doing here?  +++$+++  Barney: Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.
Barney: Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.  +++$+++  Barney: She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.
Lily: Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.  +++$+++  Barney: My life rocks! Money, suits and s*x. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.
Lily: Nope.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah.
Lily: Nope.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah.
Shannon: Oh, Barney!  +++$+++  Barney: Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?
Shannon: Is your phone on?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.
Lily: Ew, gross. Just stop it.  +++$+++  Barney: Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!
Ted from 2030: Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great.  +++$+++  Barney: Um, are you coloring in your butt?
Marshall: I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.  +++$+++  Barney: So wear another one.
Marshall: I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.
Marshall: Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.
Marshall: A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.  +++$+++  Barney: Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks "suit." Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.
Marshall: No thanks, dude.  Noon?  +++$+++  Barney: Noon. See you then.
Marshall: Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?  +++$+++  Barney: Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.
Marshall: No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now.  +++$+++  Barney: Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.
Ted: Really? You?  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.
Ted: Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.  +++$+++  Barney: Are you sure?
Ted: Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.
Marshall: Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?  +++$+++  Barney: Here. Play with this pin cushion.
Marshall: God. I'm going to look hot.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.
Marshall: No way. The Kid does not sell out.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.
Lily: Yeah, but only, like, second base.  +++$+++  Barney: Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.
Marshall: Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.  +++$+++  Barney: So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?
Marshall: Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.  +++$+++  Barney: Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.
Marshall: B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.
Marshall: You set this up! You set this whole thing up!  +++$+++  Barney: I most certainly did...
Marshall: What time is the interview?  +++$+++  Barney: 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.
Ted from 2030: Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there.  +++$+++  Barney: Go for Barney.
Voice: Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.  +++$+++  Barney: A sasquatch?
Voice: That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.
Marshall: Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...
Marshall: There's one for awesomeness?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, I had it made. Sit.
Marshall: Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?  +++$+++  Barney: Please.
Man #2: My dawg!  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.
Marshall: Where, I don't, I don't see...  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.
Marshall: I quit.  +++$+++  Barney: What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.
Marshall: We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?  +++$+++  Barney: Please.
Marshall: I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.
Marshall: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?
Marshall: The package?  +++$+++  Barney: The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.
Marshall: Lily doesn't care about that stuff.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.
Marshall: She'll be happy.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.
Marshall: Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, consider the penguins.
Marshall: The penguins?  +++$+++  Barney: On the wall.
Marshall: "Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold." This is a motivational poster?  +++$+++  Barney: Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.
Ted from 2030: And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.
Marshall: Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.
Marshall: I'm psyched!  +++$+++  Barney: What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
Marshall: Wow, that was really specific.  +++$+++  Barney: Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!
Marshall: So badly.  +++$+++  Barney: And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.
Marshall: Right. Get what done?  +++$+++  Barney: Whatever.
Marshall: Cool. And what guy is this?  +++$+++  Barney: There's always a guy.
Marshall: Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.  +++$+++  Barney: You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?
Marshall: So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?  +++$+++  Barney: Nah. I'm so over karaoke.
Marshall: Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.
Ted: I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.  +++$+++  Barney, singing: *He's giving you the blues. You want to graduate, but not in his bed. Here's what you got to do Pick up the phone...*
Ted: I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?  +++$+++  Barney, singing: *Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds. Done dirt cheap! Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow. Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...* Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?
Lily: Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...  +++$+++  Barney: So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.
Lily: He has a job doing... What do you do?  +++$+++  Barney: Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?
All: No.  +++$+++  Barney: No. I know what you want. Magic.
Marshall: Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?
Marshall &amp; Lily: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, she told me already. Go on.
Marshall: Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.
Marshall: Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.  +++$+++  Barney: That is a lie!
Marshall: It is not a lie.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!
Lily: Okay, it's time for bed.  +++$+++  Barney: What? No. It's 2:30.
Lily: Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.  +++$+++  Barney: You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.
Marshall: You never had a four-way.  +++$+++  Barney: I said "almost." All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.
Lily: We're going home.  +++$+++  Barney: What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?
Korean Elvis: Rock 'n' roll.  +++$+++  Barney: And it begins.
Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, back at the bar, Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?
Marshall: Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.  +++$+++  Barney: No! No, come on.
Marshall: Yes!  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the "le". We still got the "gen." The "da." The "ry."
Ted: I'm going to kill him.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't say I blame you.
Marshall: Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.
Marshall: No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.  +++$+++  Barney: That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.
Marshall: Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.  +++$+++  Barney: I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.
Ted: I'm going to kill him.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't say I blame you.
Ted: Barney, what are you doing here?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.
Ted: I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Ted: Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.  +++$+++  Barney: But I'm your best friend.
Ted: Well, actually Marshall's my...  +++$+++  Barney: I'm the most important person in your life.
Ted: Well, Robin's actually...  +++$+++  Barney: How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.
Robin: To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.
Ted: I know you've all been excited to meet...  +++$+++  Barney: Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint "Bless This Mess" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen?
Robin: That's funny, I didn't even "look" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.  +++$+++  Barney : San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.
Ted's mother: I love salmon risotto.  +++$+++  Barney: I know.
Robin: How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...
Ted: Stop it! Don't, don't!  +++$+++  Barney: Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?
Robin: What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.  +++$+++  Barney: Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!
Ted's mother: Can I help?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.
Ted's mother: That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.  +++$+++  Barney: No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.
Marshall: All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.  +++$+++  Barney: Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?
Ted's mother: I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.  +++$+++  Barney: St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.
Ted: Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?  +++$+++  Barney: I'll save you a seat.
Robin: Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: Susan, her name is Virginia.
Barney: Susan, her name is Virginia.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.
Ted: Why?  +++$+++  Barney: Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?
Girl: Wow. You're like a hero.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.
Ted's father: Why don't you give the guy a hug?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm... oh. .
Ted: My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.
Ted: Sure.  +++$+++  Barney: Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...
Ted: Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!  +++$+++  Barney: I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?
Ted: My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.
Ted: Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use "83%"?  +++$+++  Barney: You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.
Ted: That's not a real Web site.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.
Ted: I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene  +++$+++  Barney: Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.
Ted's mother: Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh, a piano!
Ted: Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.  +++$+++  Barney: What happened to Marshall and Lily?
Ted's mother: Teddy bear, oh...  +++$+++  Barney: You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.
Robin: We had our first fight.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, no, what'd you fight about? .
Marshall: Wow, so it's the whole package.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, you did.
Marshall: Had to.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.
Marshall: Yeah, you did.  +++$+++  Barney: Had to.
Ted: Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.  +++$+++  Barney : Can we talk about something else?
Marshall: You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?
Marshall: That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.
Ted: Robin thinks so.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.
Ted: I love it when you quote Scripture.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.
Ted: Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.  +++$+++  Barney: That's 'cause you're always like...  "Ted Mosby, architect". If it were me, I'd be like...  "Ted Mosby, architect". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude.
Marshall : Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off..  +++$+++  Barney: Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. "Ted Mosby, architect". Trust me.
Robin: What do you think you're...? Barney?  +++$+++  Barney : Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails.
Robin: Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted? He's at work.
Robin: How did you get here?  +++$+++  Barney: Awesome story. As per usual.
Girl: Yes, she did.  +++$+++  Barney : Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here.
Girl: Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, stay
Ted: Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, you did.
Ted: Yeah, had to. See ya.  +++$+++  Barney : Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave.
Girl: Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted Mosby... Architect.
Barney: Ted Mosby... Architect.  +++$+++  Barney: But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.
Marshall: Dude, dude, what are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: Galloping.
Marshall: Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: It is tonight.
Barney: It is tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.
Robin: But why would you use Ted's name?  +++$+++  Barney: I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole "using my real name" thing.
Lily: Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.  +++$+++  Barney: And thus ended this chapter of, "Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand." Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.
Robin: You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?  +++$+++  Barney: I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a "A." A... A... I'll just put "resident." Go, go, go, go.
Ted : Your Uncle Barney was always a bit of an enigma. In all the years we lived in new york, none of us had ever set foot in his apartment. Until one day, one of us did.  +++$+++  Barney: Aaaaaaah!
Robin: What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.  +++$+++  Barney: The fortress of barnitude? No way.
Robin: Come on. She's desperate.  +++$+++  Barney: Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.
Robin: I'm sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .
Lily: Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.  +++$+++  Barney: I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
Marshall: Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Laid, you say?
Marshall: You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.  +++$+++  Barney: She hot?
Marshall: Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
Robin: A what?  +++$+++  Barney: A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.
Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
Marshall: I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...  +++$+++  Barney: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.
Robin: I'm sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .
Lily: Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.  +++$+++  Barney: I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
Marshall: Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Laid, you say?
Marshall: You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.  +++$+++  Barney: She hot?
Marshall: Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
Robin: A what?  +++$+++  Barney: A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.
Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
Marshall: I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...  +++$+++  Barney: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.
Ted: I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell people what?
Robin: Hi, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell people what?
Ted: The food looks delicious, doesn't it?  +++$+++  Barney: Tell people what?
Robin: Nothing.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, okay. Tell people what?
Ted: Can we talk about this later?  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely. Tell people what?
Robin: Hi. Have you met Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?
Ted: Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. 
Robin: Can I get a water please?  +++$+++  Barney: Tell people what?
Robin: So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine.
Ted: It's pretty big, though.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God, just tell me!
Lily: Oh, that's great. Going on the list.  +++$+++  Barney: What list?
Lily: Horrible wedding cliches we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.
Marshall: Yeah...  +++$+++  Barney: Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.
Lily: No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...  +++$+++  Barney: Are those mini quiches?  Tell the secret.
Ted: Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.
Ted: What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.
Lily: Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away. So what was in the glass?
Ted: Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, "Champagne?" "We didn't order any champagne." "Compliments of the house." "Wow."  +++$+++  Barney: You said that already!
Man: Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?  +++$+++  Barney: Don't get married.
Man: Why don't I come back.  +++$+++  Barney: An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do
Lily: Oh, look, more strawberries!  +++$+++  Barney: So what happened next?
Ted: We have an expiration date, don't we?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it.
Ted: Run!  +++$+++  Barney: Run? Your strategy was run?
Robin: Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.  +++$+++  Barney: No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty.
Robin: Right? Right?  +++$+++  Barney: You caught the bouquet?
Robin: Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies.  +++$+++  Barney: That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted.
Ted: Risk it.  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Man: All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake.  +++$+++  Barney: No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over.
Robin: Come on, they're cutting the cake.  +++$+++  Barney: Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.
Lily: We love you. I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.
Ted: I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.  +++$+++  Barney: You did break up.
Ted: Yep.  +++$+++  Barney: You're not pregnant?
Robin: Nope.  +++$+++  Barney: An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?
Robin: We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.  +++$+++  Barney: You guys okay?
Ted : So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life, Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together.
Ted: Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know?  +++$+++  Barney: The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for "the one" again. The only time I want to hear you saying "the one" is if it's followed by the word "hundredth." What up?
Ted: No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?  +++$+++  Barney: Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty.
Ted: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.
Ted: Could be.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted?
Ted: Yes, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again?
Ted: I do.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it...
Lily: So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.  +++$+++  Barney: And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.
Robin: But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?  +++$+++  Barney: Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, "I do." Yeah.
Lily: So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.  +++$+++  Barney: Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross "harp player" off my list.
Marshall: How long is this list?  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.
Lily: Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.  +++$+++  Barney: Sweet! I can cross off two things.
Lily: Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, "Oh, my wedding has to be perfect." Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.  +++$+++  Barney: Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?
Barman: No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.
Barman: I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.  +++$+++  Barney: You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.
Barney: You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? "Hey, baby, want to pluck?"
Robin: Really? That didn't work.  +++$+++  Barney: Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?
Lily: Bill?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.
Bill: Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.
Lily: Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?  +++$+++  Barney: He kind of did.
Lily: Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.  +++$+++  Barney: I'll get it.
Lily: Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?  +++$+++  Barney: He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.
Lily: Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.  +++$+++  Barney: Me, too. I was up all night.
Scooter: Hello, Lily.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Bill.
Lily: I want... I want... Scooter!  +++$+++  Barney: I need a glass of wine.
Barman: And I need you to get out of my face.  +++$+++  Barney: It's for the bride, so...
Barney: It's for the bride, so...  +++$+++  Barney: White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.
Barman: You got it.  +++$+++  Barney: She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.
Barman: I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.
Barney: Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.  +++$+++  Barney: Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.
Brad: I'm on it.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey.
Woman: Hey.  +++$+++  Barney: Can I have your phone number?
Woman: No.  +++$+++  Barney: It's for the bride.
Woman: Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.  +++$+++  Barney: The bride wants you to walk slower.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, it's not too short.
Marshall: My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!  +++$+++  Barney: You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.
Marshall: I can't get married like this! There's no way!  +++$+++  Barney: Ah, let me see what I can do.
Ted: What? What can you do?  +++$+++  Barney: I have a superpower.
Marshall: Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?  +++$+++  Barney: Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?
Ted: Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.  +++$+++  Barney: The bride needs this.
Marshall: Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.
Marshall: Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?  +++$+++  Barney: It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.
Ted: Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.
Marshall: Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.
Robin: He's gonna cry.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?
Ted: No problem.  +++$+++  Barney: It's totally okay.
Lily: I'm good.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?
Lily: Slow down.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?
Marshall: I do.  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?
Lily: I do.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.
Marshall: Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?
Ted: Long story. I'll tell you later.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.
Marshall: Oh, you didn't. That's right.  +++$+++  Barney: So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?
Lily: Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.  +++$+++  Barney: Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying "night-night" to her?
Lily: He doesn't say it. He sings it.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.
Lily: Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.  +++$+++  Barney: What's on there?
Lily: Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...  +++$+++  Barney: Retail price $319.99. What else?
Lily: Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?
Marshall: Did you memorize our registry?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm training.
Marshall: Training? For what?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?
Ted: Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.
Ted: What?!  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.
Robin: Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.  +++$+++  Barney: Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.
Marshall: His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.  +++$+++  Barney: So which one, "A" or "B"?
Marshall: What was that?  +++$+++  Barney: I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, "Barney Stinson, come on down!"
Ted: Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, of course.
Barney: Yeah, of course.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.
Ted : Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.  +++$+++  Barney: Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready?
Marshall: Oh, wow, that was pretty close.  +++$+++  Barney: Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!
Ted: What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.
Ted: Your father?  +++$+++  Barney: That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.
Ted: Your dad... is Bob Barker?  +++$+++  Barney: That's right
Lily: The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?  +++$+++  Barney: That's Pops.
Robin: Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.
Barney: Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.  +++$+++  Barney: Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?
Barney: Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?  +++$+++  Barney's mom: Oh, I don't know. That guy.
Barney's mom: Oh, I don't know. That guy.  +++$+++  Barney):Look, Dad, I got straight A's!
Bareny : Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?  +++$+++  Barney : Want to play some catch, Pop?
Barney : Want to play some catch, Pop?  +++$+++  Barney: So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.
Ted: You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?  +++$+++  Barney: Why is this so hard for you people to believe?
Ted : Man, I'm well nourished right now!  +++$+++  Barney: Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.
Rich: Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.  +++$+++  Barney: Nooo. Oh, my God!
Bob: Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.  +++$+++  Barney: Thanks, Da... Bob.
Bob: And Barney, what do you bid on that?  +++$+++  Barney: Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.
Bob: Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you, Bob.
Bob: Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.  +++$+++  Barney: $1 billion.
Bob: Lower.  +++$+++  Barney: So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.
Bob: That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.  +++$+++  Barney: No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.
Bob: That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...  +++$+++  Barney: $999.
At the apartement, Lily: Oh, my...  +++$+++  Barney: I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game.
Bob: I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.  +++$+++  Barney: Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.
Bob: Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?
Bob: Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?  +++$+++  Barney: Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.
Bob: $17,640.  +++$+++  Barney: Overbid!
Bob: Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I love this.
Bob: Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?  +++$+++  Barney: Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1.
Bob: And the actual retail price of your showcase is...  +++$+++  Barney: $14,628.
Bob: $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...  +++$+++  Barney: Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.
Bob: Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...  +++$+++  Barney: Have your pets spayed or neutered.
Ted: Why didn't you tell him?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.
Ted: Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.  +++$+++  Barney: Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!
Robin: We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.  +++$+++  Barney: We insisted.
Ted: Terrific.  +++$+++  Barney: How's the Fiero?
Lily: Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, I'm trying, but it's...
Lily: Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.
Lily: No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.  +++$+++  Barney: Aw, nerts.
Marshall: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Seems impossible.
Ted: That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.  +++$+++  Barney: With privileges, from the sound of it.
Mechanic: Eriksen.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.
Marshall: I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.  +++$+++  Barney: How dare you...
Marshall: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.
Robin: Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?  +++$+++  Barney: Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!
Lily: What? Why?  +++$+++  Barney: Why? Why? Why?! Why?!
Ted: Hey.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.
Ted: Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.
Ted: To Queens?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.
Ted:Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.
Ted: Wait! You know how to drive, right?  +++$+++  Barney: What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.
Ted: Which pedal's the gas?  +++$+++  Barney: Trick question.
Ted: No, it's not  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, it is.
Ted: No, it's not.  +++$+++  Barney: Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.
Ted: Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.  +++$+++  Barney: This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.
Ted: Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, a dog.
Ted: Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.  +++$+++  Barney: What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.
Ted: Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.  +++$+++  Barney: Which? Which one's the break again?
Ted: The left one.  +++$+++  Barney: Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.
Ted: Why did you just turn on the radio?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.
Ted: Relax. You're being crazy.  +++$+++  Barney: Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.
Ted: Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!  +++$+++  Barney: I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.
Ted: We're okay.  +++$+++  Barney: We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!
Ted: Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...  +++$+++  Barney: ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.
Lily: So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.  +++$+++  Barney: True story.
Marshall: Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes!
Marshall: Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace.  +++$+++  Barney: Rot in hell, devil steed.
Marshall: Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know. Is she fat?
Lily: Hot off the presses!  +++$+++  Barney: I-I don't take flyers.
Marshall: You took one two seconds before you walked in here.  +++$+++  Barney: That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?
Lily: Fine. It's a flyer from my play.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...
Marshall: Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.
Ted: Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, you should break up.
Ted: I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, God, why is this part of the story?
Lily: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!  +++$+++  Barney: What's wrong with her?
Marshall: She hates that word.  +++$+++  Barney: What word, "moist"?
Ted: Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.
Lily: Yes!  +++$+++  Barney: I vote they can stay. "Check out the jackass in the parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.
Marshall: They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.
Ted: All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.  +++$+++  Barney: I side with Robin.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.
Robin: Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?  +++$+++  Barney: From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.
Ted: Where do you guys want to sit?  +++$+++  Barney: I know where I don't want to sit.
Marshall : Guys, four together!  +++$+++  Barney: I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.
Robin: Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.  +++$+++  Barney: No? Okay.
Lily: I am Rage... Envy!  +++$+++  Barney: I am outta here.
Robin: And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, "Now we are really cookin'!"  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, Lily, that sucked!
Marshall: Barney!  +++$+++  Barney: What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.
Lily: No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, if you're a Smurf.
Lily: You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, really? You would?
Lily: Yes.  +++$+++  Barney: Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.
Lily: What's the matter with you?  +++$+++  Barney: Even I wouldn't do that.
Marshall: I miss Jebediah.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.
Lily: Very funny.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.
Lily: Oh, we'll be there.  +++$+++  Barney: Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...
Lily: Never.  +++$+++  Barney: Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.
Lily: I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.  +++$+++  Barney: Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.
Ted : That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.  +++$+++  Barney: Moist.
Ted : And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.  +++$+++  Barney: I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.
Ted : And then it just got weird.  +++$+++  Barney: Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!
Lily: Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?
Lily: No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting
Lily: Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.  +++$+++  Barney: Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.
Lily: Yeah, well, anyway.  +++$+++  Barney: Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?
Barney: Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?  +++$+++  Barney: It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.
Ted and Robin: We're moving in together!  +++$+++  Barney: The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four.
Marshall: Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.  +++$+++  Barney: Training for a marathon.
Marshall: What?  +++$+++  Barney: You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.
Marshall: You're kidding, right?  +++$+++  Barney: Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.
Marshall: So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely.
Ted: Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.  +++$+++  Barney: Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.
Marshall:  +++$+++  Barney: 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.
Marshall: You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.
Lily: Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!  +++$+++  Barney: What up, non-finishers?
Ted: Wow. Very impressive, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.
Lily: I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.  +++$+++  Barney: So where's my 50 bucks?
Marshall: All right. I got to admit, you earned this.  +++$+++  Barney: Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.
Marshall: Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow. You know I really should check out this "subway." Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.
Ted: You're dating a girl from New Jersey?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Ted: Hello?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.
Ted: What, what are you talking about?  +++$+++  Barney: I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.
Barney: I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.  +++$+++  Barney: Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.
Voice: 86th street.  +++$+++  Barney: My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.
Marshall: Best 50 bucks I ever spent.  +++$+++  Barney: Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?
Ted: All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, Ted.
Woman: Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry. I can't.
Ted: Barney?!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted!
Policeman: Hey!  +++$+++  Barney: No...!
Lily: You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.  +++$+++  Barney:  I can't go. I've got this thing.
Lily: What thing?  +++$+++  Barney: A pen1s.
Narrator: Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.  +++$+++  Barney:...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full.
Ted: I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.  +++$+++  Barney: When will you be ready?
Narrator: I grew my breakup beard.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.
Narrator: I repainted the apartment.  +++$+++  Barney: Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah.
Narrator: And the truth is, I was doing really good.  +++$+++  Barney: Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get "Cirque de So-Laid". What up?
Marshall: That's my wife.  +++$+++  Barney: Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?
Gael: Gael.  +++$+++  Barney: Kyle?
Ted:  What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.  +++$+++  Barney: That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.
Gael: Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.  +++$+++  Barney: How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.
Marshall: It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.  +++$+++  Barney: I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.
Lily: Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...  +++$+++  Barney: Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?
Marshall: I am such a jerk.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. Wait, why?
Marshall: Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.  +++$+++  Barney: That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.
Ted: Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.  +++$+++  Barney: No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...
Robin: And here I am at the drum circle.  +++$+++  Barney: Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.
Lily: Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.  +++$+++  Barney: You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker.
Lily: Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.  +++$+++  Barney: What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.
Robin: I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.  +++$+++  Barney: Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a "Best if banged by" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being "Unevolved Robin", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.
Ted: I'm just happy Robin's happy.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm telling you, within three days...
Lily: Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.  +++$+++  Barney: Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association.
Gael: What are we talking of? Baseball?  +++$+++  Barney: This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.
Gael: My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... "Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother."  And that's all I remember until the hospital.  +++$+++  Barney: That guy...
Ted: Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.  +++$+++  Barney: Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?
Ted: He's better looking than us.  +++$+++  Barney: No. Because he's from out of town.
Ted: Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?
Ted: Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.  +++$+++  Barney:  Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?
Ted: Oh.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted.
Colleen: Hi, um, I'm Colleen.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, Colleen.
Colleen: This is Lindsay.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, Lindsay.
Ted: Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah.
Lindsay: Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch?  +++$+++  Barney: Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?
Colleen: We'll see you tomorrow.  +++$+++  Barney: All right.
Ted: I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. All right.
Ted: Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.  +++$+++  Barney: Use your words, Ted.
Ted: OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.  +++$+++  Barney: The belt?
Ted: The belt.  +++$+++  Barney: But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.
Marshall: Yes, advantage Ericksen.  +++$+++  Barney: Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.
Ted: What? We agreed, I suited up.  +++$+++  Barney: You take too long to get ready
Marshall: Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.  +++$+++  Barney: And then he starts on his hair. Ace.
Ted: Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?  +++$+++  Barney: Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.
Ted: Really?  +++$+++  Barney, Marshall: Yes.
Lily: You just made the list, bitch.  +++$+++  Barney: So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?
Robin: Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.  +++$+++  Barney: FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.
Marshall: Shekwakie.  +++$+++  Barney: Stinson.
Ted: All right, the beers are here.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, we're not gonna make it.
Ted: Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, pants are off.
Marshall: Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.  +++$+++  Barney: That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.
Barney: That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.  +++$+++  Barney: Stinson.
Ted: I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.  +++$+++  Barney: You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.
Ted: So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.  +++$+++  Barney: So you now have two on the line?
Ted: And I don't know which one to go for.  +++$+++  Barney: Go for the new girl.
Barney: Go for the new girl.  +++$+++  Barney: Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.
Lily: New girl? What new girl?  +++$+++  Barney: Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...
Marshall: I thought we were in for the evening.  +++$+++  Barney: That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.
Ted: It's a tricycle.  +++$+++  Barney: No way, no way, no way!
Lily: Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.  +++$+++  Barney: Put him on speaker.
Barney: Put him on speaker.  +++$+++  Barney: So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt?
Ted: You actually bought a belt.  +++$+++  Barney: That's right, it's resplendent.
Ted: It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.  +++$+++  Barney: I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...
Ted: Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?  +++$+++  Barney: All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?
Ted: Yes.  +++$+++  Barney: Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.
Ted: Yes.  +++$+++  Barney: Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?
Ted: What? No.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted?
Waitress: No, but fifty will.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars.
Ted: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: I cannot allow Ted to do this.
Ted: Why, why?  +++$+++  Barney: Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.
Marshall: But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.  +++$+++  Barney: I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.
Barney: I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.  +++$+++  Barney: So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?
Brunette Girl: OK.  +++$+++  Barney: I'll get the video camera.
Blonde Girl: Get out!  +++$+++  Barney: OK then.
Ted: Wish me luck.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh my God.
Marshall: Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.  +++$+++  Barney: Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot.
Blonde Girl: So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh no, the night's ruined!
Brunette Girl: No, baby, it's not.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?
Marshall: Why would you do that to yourself?  +++$+++  Barney: Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.
Ted: See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?  +++$+++  Barney: The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.
Ted: It won't?  +++$+++  Barney: No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.
Ted: Why would I want to tire them out?  +++$+++  Barney: That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.
Ted: OK, what the hell.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, wait for it.
Ted: Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes you can.
Ted: I'll see you on the other side.  +++$+++  Barney: So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.
Barney: So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.  +++$+++  Barney: What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.
Barney: What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.  +++$+++  Barney: You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?
Barney: You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?  +++$+++  Barney: You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!
Ted: Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.  +++$+++  Barney: Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?
Barney: Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, belt.
Barney: Did you? Did you? Or didn't you?  +++$+++  Barney: Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?
Lily: What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.  +++$+++  Barney: She's totally hot and really fun.
Barney: She's totally hot and really fun.  +++$+++  Barney:  But she has a dead tooth.
Robin: Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.  +++$+++  Barney: If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!
Robin: I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my v*g1n*  +++$+++  Barney: Shotgun.
Marshall: You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.  +++$+++  Barney: Nice.
Lily:  But she's a gun nut.  +++$+++  Barney:  But she's Canadian.
Marshall:  But she didn't like Field of Dreams.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't think of anything.
Ted: You don't have a 'but'.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.
Ted: Why?  +++$+++  Barney: The ultimate ice breaker.
Barney: The ultimate ice breaker.  +++$+++  Barney: A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.
Ted: So, what are the eye patches for?  +++$+++  Barney: We got bit.
Ted: Both of us.  +++$+++  Barney: They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!
Ted: OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, Theodore...
Barney: Oh, Theodore...  +++$+++  Barney:...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.
Ted: Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.
Ted: Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow.
Marshall: I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, Marshall.
Marshall: Yes.  +++$+++  Barney: Which one of us has more game?
Marshall: Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.  +++$+++  Barney: What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.
Marshall: You're joking. I have mad game, bra.  +++$+++  Barney: OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.
Marshall: What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.
Marshall: Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.
Ted: Fine.  +++$+++  Barney: There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...
Ted: Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.  +++$+++  Barney: That's good too.
Barney: That's good too.  +++$+++  Barney: How about her?
Ted: You're on.  +++$+++  Barney: Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?
Ted: Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.  +++$+++  Barney: I win.
Ted: How?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.
Ted: Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.
Ted: Get out of my way.  +++$+++  Barney: By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.
Ted: You see this. Game face.  +++$+++  Barney: Whatever, Ted.
Ted: Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.
Marshall: I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have s*x twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had s*x a total of...wait for it...  +++$+++  Barney: Nice.
Marshall: One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had s*x and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.  +++$+++  Barney: Doesn't count.
Ted: You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had s*x once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.
Ted: Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.  +++$+++  Barney: We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.
Barney: We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on what I've already gone  on.
Ted: Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.
Ted: Fine.  +++$+++  Barney: And I only stirred that with my pinky.
Ted: What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.  +++$+++  Barney: That's what you think happened.
Ted: OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...  +++$+++  Barney: Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?
Stacy: You are so sweet.  +++$+++  Barney: So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.
Ted: So you never slept with her?  +++$+++  Barney: Not even at all.
Marshall: Wow, that's good.  +++$+++  Barney: It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?
Ted: Well., have fun in yoga  +++$+++  Barney: Well?
Barney: Well?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh.
Stacy: I'm sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Stacy, right?
Stacy: Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?
Ted: She plays bass in a reggae band.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.
Stacy: Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.  +++$+++  Barney: No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.
Stacy, Barney: See you later alligator.  +++$+++  Barney: We are two peas.
Barney: We are two peas.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, take care. Namaste.
Ted: You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.  +++$+++  Barney: So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.
Barney: So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.  +++$+++  Barney: Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches.
Ted: No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...  +++$+++  Barney: Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.
Barney: Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.
Stacy: You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.  +++$+++  Barney: That's what makes you so special, baby.
Ted from 2030: Back when we were dating robin and I had this running joke. We were the only two people in the world who found it funny.  +++$+++  Barney: No way! March does not have 31 days.
Ted from 2030: But most importantly, you can never, ever be alone together.  +++$+++  Barney: I gotta go.
Marshall: Yeah, this is gonna be the best Slapsgiving ever.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Robin: I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,"the real Thanksgiving"? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?
Robin: Canadian Thanksgiving celebrates explorer martin frobisher's valiant yet ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the northwest passage.  +++$+++  Barney: Why are you guys even a country?
Marshall: Oh, hey, by the way, if anyone wants to come over early thursday, we can watch the Slapsgiving day parade.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, there, you said it again.
Marshall: Said what?  +++$+++  Barney: Slapsgiving.
Marshall, on the phone with Barney: slapcountdown.com.  +++$+++  Barney: no.
Barney: no.  +++$+++  Barney: No, no. The countdown ends at 3:00 p.m., the day after Thanksgiving. I counted it out.
Ted: How many days are in october?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, thirty.
Ted: Dude, I thought we cleared this up last year.  +++$+++  Barney, with a funny accent: I like Halloween very much. Is nice.
Ted: Is also tomorrow.  +++$+++  Barney: Damn it!
Barney: Damn it!  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, you're gonna slap me on Thanksgiving?
Marshall: Slapsgiving.  +++$+++  Barney: That's not allowed. Lily, you're the slap bet commissioner, is that allowed?
Lily: The hostess in me who's using her wedding china for the first time wants to say hell, no, but yeah, I 'm going to allow it.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...
Marshall: Slapsgiving.  +++$+++  Barney:...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.
Marhall: Really?  +++$+++  Barney: Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.
Ted: How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?  +++$+++  Barney: Nothing but respect for that man.
Ted: I'm going to make a phone call.  Hey, it's me. listen, you have to come over here and make pies.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.
Ted: Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.
Ted: You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.
Ted: So you're not coming to make pies.  +++$+++  Barney: No, no. Thank you, mr. President.  Sorry.
Marshall: In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.  +++$+++  Barney: Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the killer does not grab a bullhorn and announce, "Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness."
Ted: I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...
Ted: Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had s*x seven times?  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh. terrible.
Robin: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: She's got you making pies for this guy?
Marshall: Horrible idea.  +++$+++  Barney: Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!
Lily: You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have s*x again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?  +++$+++  Barney: Um, most Thanksgivings.
Marshall: Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not scared.
Marshall: Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.  +++$+++  Barney: Please don't slap me.
Marshall: I'm sorry, what?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!
Marshall: I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.
Marshall: Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.  +++$+++  Barney: Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!
Marshall: What?!  +++$+++  Barney: Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!
Ted from 2030: So we sat down to our first Thanksgiving together as a group...and, apparently, our last.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?
Lily: Oh, no...  +++$+++  Barney: I thought we were done with that?
Ted from 2030: You see kids, friendship is an involuntary reflex... It just happens,you can't help it. That first Thanksgiving turned out to be a wonderful dinner with the four people I love most in the world... and Bob and it did become a tradition. That's why every year,we go to aunt Lily and uncle Marshall's for Thanksgiving.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.
Lily: Barney, put it away.  +++$+++  Barney: How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?
Voice: The slap will occur in ten..  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!
Voice:...six...  +++$+++  Barney: I will in... five...
Voice:...three...  +++$+++  Barney: What?! Wait, you...
Ted from 2030: Kids, in the spring of 2008 something kind of strange have been happening to your uncle Barney. He's been doing great with a woman.  +++$+++  Barney: So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I shoot the tank, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.
Ted from 2030: He's only been gone a few moments but when he return...  +++$+++  Barney: So where were we?
Ted from 2030: Until finally Lily was approached by a mysterious woman who wants her stay away from Barney...so when it happened once more...  +++$+++  Barney: Again? Really? Wait...
Ted from 2030: Barney knew who to look for...  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?
Woman: No.  +++$+++  Barney: What are you doing on Friday?
Barney: What are you doing on Friday?  +++$+++  Barney: Stop! Amy?
Abby: Abby.  +++$+++  Barney: Riiiggghhhttt!!!
Lily: Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.  +++$+++  Barney: Why are you trying to ruin my life?
Abby: Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.  +++$+++  Barney: And?
Abby: That's it.  +++$+++  Barney: That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.
Abby: Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.
Abby: Abby!  +++$+++  Barney: Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.
Abby: Ted said Marshall was his best friend.  +++$+++  Barney: Seven years!
Abby: Sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid "meaningful relationship" with Stella.
Abby: I hate Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: I hate Ted more.
Abby: Are you as turned on as I am?  +++$+++  Barney: Probably not quite as much.
Abby: I'm sorry I yelled out "Ted."  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry I yelled out "Abby."
Abby: I am Abby.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, cool.
Abby: You know what I hate most about Ted?  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Abby: His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.  +++$+++  Barney: You know what I hate most about Ted?
Abby: What?  +++$+++  Barney: How he's always like, "Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have s*x with." He's so lame.
Abby: He's so lame and awesome.  +++$+++  Barney: You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.
Abby: Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  +++$+++  Barney: I think so.
Lily: That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?
Ted: Uh, yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, Abby.
Ted: Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?  +++$+++  Barney: That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?
Abby: That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.
Abby: We're showing Ted how lame he is.  +++$+++  Barney: You don't have to say it, though.
Ted: Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.  +++$+++  Barney: Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.
Ted: Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.  +++$+++  Barney: Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?
Abby: Wait, really?  +++$+++  Barney: I would never joke about true love.
Abby: Yes, I'll marry you.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay.
Abby: Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.  +++$+++  Barney: That's you.
Ted: Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, yes, she does.
Abby: It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.  +++$+++  Barney: Totally committed to the bit.
Abby: Hi, sweetie.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?
Abby: No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.
Abby: So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.  +++$+++  Barney: Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.
Abby: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.
Abby: Really?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.
Abby: Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.
Narrator: Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life.  The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?
Ted: It's Barney.  Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.  +++$+++  Barney : Ted, I'm sorry, I haven't returned your calls.
Ted:  Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?
Ted: No I'm not.  +++$+++  Barney: Sh! Let it out, let it out.
Randy: Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?  +++$+++  Barney: No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.
Narrator: So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.  +++$+++  Barney:  Pitt, Barney Stinson!
Pitt: Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight.
Pitt: You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.  +++$+++  Barney: So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock?
Barney: So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock?  +++$+++  Barney: Starry Porten, Barney Stinson.
Starry: What up, chef?  +++$+++  Barney: I need a new bro, what do you say?
Starry: Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck.
Barney: Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck.  +++$+++  Barney: Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.
Willie: What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes finally!
Willie: Hello?  +++$+++  Barney: Hanging up on you once wasn't enough.
Robin: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute?  Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?
Stella: It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey.
Randy: What up bro-seph Lieberman?  +++$+++  Barney: No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word "bro" in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.
Randy:  Goodbye "Geraldine Ferrar-bro".  +++$+++  Barney: You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.
Randy: What a loser.  +++$+++  Barney: But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.
Randy: Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this.
Randy: Ok.  +++$+++  Barney: You ready?
Randy: Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no!  +++$+++  Barney: What? What's the matter?
Randy: Nothing, let's do this.  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!  +++$+++  Barney: Randy what are you doing?
Randy: Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!  +++$+++  Barney:  Hey, laddies. Have you met...
Stella: Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having s*x.  +++$+++  Barney: 13 years??!!
Ted from 2030: Well, kids, here we are. We've arrived, my 30th birthday. The long-awaited story of...the goat. That week started just like any other. Barney woke up in some girl's bed.  +++$+++  Barney: In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.
Robin: Check.  +++$+++  Barney: Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.
Robin: And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, "who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?"  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend
Robin: And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.  +++$+++  Barney: Best friend.
Robin: Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.
Robin: Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Right. So, Robin?
Robin: Yes, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?
Robin: I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.
Ted: So, tell us, what was it like?  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Ted: Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.  +++$+++  Barney: I... I... I'm... I'm...
Lily: It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.  +++$+++  Barney: What are you talking about?!
Ted: The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?  +++$+++  Barney: Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, "try again." How you doing there, Robin?
Ted: Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?
Robin: I'm gonna get a drink.  +++$+++  Barney: I'll come with you.
Robin: Okay.  +++$+++  Barney: God, this is awkward.
Robin: What is?  +++$+++  Barney: Being around Ted.
Robin: Why?  +++$+++  Barney: Because of our thing.
Robin: What thing?  +++$+++  Barney: You're really gonna pretend this never happened?
Ted: Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.  +++$+++  Barney: Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.
Marshall: Hello.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Marshall, I need your help.
Marshall: Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.  +++$+++  Barney: I know. I want to hire you.
Marshall: For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.  +++$+++  Barney: I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.
Marshall: How much?  +++$+++  Barney: A little.
Marshall: Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at war with Portugal.  +++$+++  Barney: Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?
Marshall: Of course. Why are you upset?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.
Marshall: No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...  +++$+++  Barney: You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept...  Stop..stop doing that.  I slept... I slept with Robin.
Marshall: You slept with Robin?  +++$+++  Barney: Are you mad at me?
Marshall: I don't know.  +++$+++  Barney: How's the hot dog?
Marshall: It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.  +++$+++  Barney: You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.
Marshall: Why are you doing this to me?!  +++$+++  Barney: Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.
Marshall: How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?  +++$+++  Barney: I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.
Ted from 2030: For many years, we had heard Barney quote the Bro Code, a list of do's and don'ts for all bros. Some were basic.  +++$+++  Barney: Bro Code article one:"Bros before hoes."
Ted from 2030: Some were unbelievably complicated.  +++$+++  Barney: Bro Code article 89: "The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing."
Ted from 2030: And some were just plain disturbing.  +++$+++  Barney: Bro Code article 34: "Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way." Two dudes.
Marshall: This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.  +++$+++  Barney: You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?
Barney: You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?  +++$+++  Barney: The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.
Benjamin: And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.  +++$+++  Barney: I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.
George: It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.  +++$+++  Barney: And I shall l include a provision that stateth "No eye contact in a devil's three-way."
Marshall: Listen, what do you want me for?  +++$+++  Barney: I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?
Marshall: Yeah, because you slept with Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states "No s*x with your bro's ex." But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.
Marshall: And you would pay me for that?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.
Marshall: Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!
Robin: Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.  +++$+++  Barney: Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.
Marshall: I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.  +++$+++  Barney: No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.
Ted: Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.  +++$+++  Barney: What?!
Ted: Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey.
Woman: That feels nice.  +++$+++  Barney: Good.
Woman: I just wish we had some wine.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.
Barney: Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.  +++$+++  Barney: Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!
Marshall: Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.  +++$+++  Barney: What if he never wants to talk to me again?
Lily: Hey, where are you?  +++$+++  Barney:I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.
Lily: Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...  +++$+++  Barney: Goat in a party hat?
Ted from 2030: In a few short hours, Lily would come to regret those words. But we'll get there.  +++$+++  Barney:Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.
Ted: Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?  +++$+++  Barney: Vegas.
Ted: Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.  +++$+++  Barney: Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.
Ted: So there's no roof party?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!
Ted: Take me home, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.
Ranjit: You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!  +++$+++  Barney: When did you find out?
Ted: Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.  +++$+++  Barney: So you're not mad?
Ted: No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm so relieved to hear you say that.
Ted: Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!  +++$+++  Barney: You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.
Ted: How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.  +++$+++  Barney: You mean... what position?  Stop it! Stop it!
Ranjit: Hit him!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted! Stop!
Ranjit: Hit him!  +++$+++  Barney: Stop!
Ranjit: Hit him!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free shot. On me. Anywhere but the face.  Who punches someone in the groin? Okay.Okay. I deserved that. I deserved that. But what's important now is... we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?
Ted: You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, "don't do this"?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...
Ted: I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled "stuff I have no use for anymore."  +++$+++  Barney: What does that mean?
Ted: It means... maybe you belong in that box.  +++$+++  Barney: Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?
Ted: I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.
Robin: And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?
Robin: Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?
Robin: No, it wasn't like that.  +++$+++  Barney: Sounds to me like he gave you your first "O, Canada!" face.
Ted from 2030:...and others were obvious, but needed to be said...  +++$+++  Barney: Did you ride his Zamboni?
Robin: Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.  +++$+++  Barney: Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.
Robin: Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.  +++$+++  Barney: You're starting out with two big ones right there.
Robin: No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?
Robin: I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.  +++$+++  Barney: Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.
Barney: Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: So, Simon, how did you guys meet?
Simon: Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry. I've seen "Let's Go to the Mall" about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.
Simon: No, I was in the other one.  +++$+++  Barney: There's another video?!
Barney: There's another video?!  +++$+++  Barney: Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.
Robin: No.  +++$+++  Barney: All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.
Marshall: You know who gets really bad revertigo?  Lily when she around her high school friend, Michelle.  +++$+++  Barney: Michelle? She sounds hot.
Ted: You don't know about Lily and Michelle?  +++$+++  Barney: No. What about Lily and Michelle?
Lily: Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.  +++$+++  Barney: What... ) Do they make out?
Ted: The coup de grace.  +++$+++  Barney: Finish him!
Lily: For reals.  +++$+++  Barney: I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.
Ted from 2030: One by one, we all had to go home. Soon, it was just Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?
Robin: Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.
Robin: No, tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh. Really? Oh! Oh, come here.
Robin: It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.  +++$+++  Barney: Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.
Robin: Right. Of course, the-the first being you.  +++$+++  Barney: No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.
Robin: Barney, do you want to come back to my place?  +++$+++  Barney: Your place?
Barney: Your place?  +++$+++  Barney: Are you sure you want to do this?
Robin: Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course. So, should I just put it in?
Robin: This was my big artistic follow-up to"Let's Go to the Mall." It kind of tanked.  +++$+++  Barney: Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.
Robin: Oh, I'm so glad.  +++$+++  Barney: Is that Alan Thicke?
Robin: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?
Robin: Yeah, you're right. I was lame.  +++$+++  Barney: Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.
Ted: A new car!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. Shotgun for eternity!
Robin: You can't call shotgun for eternity.  +++$+++  Barney: I just called it.
Robin: You can't just call things, barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I call that I can call things!
Lily: Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?
Ted: Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?  +++$+++  Barney: I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.
Marshall: I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...  +++$+++  Barney: Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.
Barney: Just because you weren't around for this, I called shotgun for all eternity in Ted's car.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.
Marshall: And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.
Marshall: It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.  +++$+++  Barney: Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.
Barney: Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.  +++$+++  Barney: Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.
Blauman: You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, snap.
Blauman: Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.  +++$+++  Barney, pouring some water in a glass: Does this help?
Barney, pouring some water in a glass: Does this help?  +++$+++  Barney: Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website tanked. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.
Marshall: That's it? that's the end of the story?  +++$+++  Barney: No, no, of course not... he died.
Marshall: How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.
Marshall: Chain of screaming?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.
Ted: I thought it was a chain of screaming.  +++$+++  Barney: It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.
Robin: So it's not a circle.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?
Lily: Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, God.
Marshall: After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, marshall.
Marshall: How long have you been sitting there?  +++$+++  Barney: If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?
Marshall: Yeah, I was just about to order.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you want?
Waiter: Okay, friends, what do you like?  +++$+++  Barney: A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.
Marshall: No, I didn't want meatloaf.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.
Marshall: No, I don't.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.
Marshall: Who would I even scream at?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.
Marshall: I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.
Waiter: One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall.
Waiter: No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, what are you guys doing out here?
Ted: Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.
Ted: Well, that's just not true.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called shotgun for all eternity.
Robin:You can't call shotgun for eternity.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, that's funny, cause I did!
Marshall: Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!  +++$+++  Barney: A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?
Marshall: I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...  +++$+++  Barney: I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.
Marshall: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Yell at me.
Marshall: I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best shot.
Marshall: Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah.
Marshall: This is me yelling at you, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.
Marshall: This is me yelling at you, Barney!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.
Marshall: You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!  +++$+++  Barney: No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.
Marshall: Your mom's a slut!  +++$+++  Barney: Yes.
Marshall: Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!  +++$+++  Barney: Keep going.
Marshall: I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.
Marshall: Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm kidding... keep going.
Ted: I'm sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.
Ted: Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, screaming never solves anything.
Ted: That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.  +++$+++  Barney: Your team lost 20 minutes ago.
Lily: You okay, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.
Robin: Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?  +++$+++  Barney: There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.
Robin: Of course there are.  +++$+++  Barney: Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.
Lily: You could not be more evil.  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...
Barney: Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...  +++$+++  Barney: Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.
Barney: Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.  +++$+++  Barney: I was only gone for a second when...
Barney: I was only gone for a second when...  +++$+++  Barney: See? Skid-proof.
Barney: See? Skid-proof.  +++$+++  Barney: The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.
Ted: Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.
Ted: I'm really bored at work.  +++$+++  Barney: I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.
Woman: Oh, I want to take her home right now.  +++$+++  Barney: Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?
Woman, slapping him: Jerk!  +++$+++  Barney: Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.
Lily: Ooh, ooh, ooh!  +++$+++  Barney: Lily.
Lily: You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.  +++$+++  Barney: No. Marshall.
Marshall: You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh. No. Robin.
Robin: You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.  +++$+++  Barney: Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...
Barney: Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...  +++$+++  Barney: At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.
Woman: I'm so sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.
Barney: My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.  +++$+++  Barney: Why does this keep happening?
Lily: Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.
Ted from 2030: But the next night got even weirder.  +++$+++  Barney: Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.
Lily: You never gonna believe what just happened.  +++$+++  Barney: Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?
Lily: Alan Alda?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Mystery woman: Hey, a word of advice? That guy you were talking to, Barney Stinson... I know he seems charming, but he's just saying whatever it takes to get in your pants. Sleeping with Barney was the biggest mistake of my life.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God. Where is she?
Lily: She must have left. She...  +++$+++  Barney: Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?
Lily: She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.  +++$+++  Barney: Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?
Lily: Yes!  +++$+++  Barney: That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!
Barney: That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!  +++$+++  Barney: Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?
Lily: It's karma.  +++$+++  Barney: Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.
Ted: Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?  +++$+++  Barney: My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.
Ted: Come on, let's see the list.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.
Barney: Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.  +++$+++  Barney: This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?
Ted: How many of these girls know they're being photographed?  +++$+++  Barney: All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.
Robin: Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.
Lily: I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.  +++$+++  Barney: This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?
Barney: This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?  +++$+++  Barney: The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.
Robin: Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.
Robin: Damn it!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, toss up. "Thought I was Jorge Posada," or "You have my dead wife's kidney?"
Lily: She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!  +++$+++  Barney: That's true...
Ted: I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.  +++$+++  Barney: Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, "Girl who thought I owned Google," up against the number seven seed, "Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor."
Ted: She got the bends!  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, she did.
Robin: Barney, you're the tiebreaker.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm going with Evil Twin.
Ted: You're kidding me!  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.
Lily: Is that the blackboard from my classroom?  +++$+++  Barney: Come on! Marshall?
Marshall: I'm tired and sad.  +++$+++  Barney: Mosby?
Ted: I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.
Lily: You guys stole my blackboard!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.
Lily: No.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you mean "no"?
Lily: That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, "I'm sorry."  +++$+++  Barney: Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had s*x with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.
Lily: Barney, you're doing this.  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!
Lily: Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: If she kills me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.
Meg: What are you doing here?  +++$+++  Barney: Look, Meg, we need to talk.
Meg: It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.  +++$+++  Barney: And I forgive you. I love you.
Lily: No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...  +++$+++  Barney: So you remember who this one is, right?
Lily: Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.  +++$+++  Barney: Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...
Lily: Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah, there she is.
Lily: Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.  +++$+++  Barney: You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
Lily: I'm making a scrapbook.  +++$+++  Barney: Anna, hi.
Anna: Look who it is, Mr. Big Shot Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.  +++$+++  Barney: What Web site?
Anna: Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.  +++$+++  Barney: You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.
Lily: Okay, which one is this again?  +++$+++  Barney: She's...
Kate: Larney! Die!  +++$+++  Barney: Is it her?
Lily: Smile.  +++$+++  Barney: You look good. Have you lost weight?
Barney: You look good. Have you lost weight?  +++$+++  Barney: We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.
Lily: That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.  +++$+++  Barney: But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.
Holly: Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Holly.
Mark: And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.  +++$+++  Barney: Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.
Lily: We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.  +++$+++  Barney: No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.
Robin: Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.  +++$+++  Barney: That's not a bad idea.
Robin: No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm in.
Robin:...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.  +++$+++  Barney: Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!
Robin: I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, there, how are you doing?
Robin: Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?
Robin: Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.
Robin: You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?  +++$+++  Barney: Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?
Robin: No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have s*x.
Marshall: I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands?  Barney. I brought a copy of the bracket. Which one is she?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.
Ted: Are you okay?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.
Lily: Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: What? What?
Robin: Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.  +++$+++  Barney: So I apologized for nothing?
Robin: These guys think what? I am far from my phase "dating a prisoner." It's like: "Hi, I am over 19 years."  +++$+++  Barney: The daughter of the lottery is there.
Robin: I'm sorry for these women. This is where careers go to die on TV.  +++$+++  Barney: Look. It's funny. I invented a little game
Presenter: The lotto numbers tonight are... 19...  +++$+++  Barney: Your age on arrival in New York after a photographer you have "discovered" to be published in Vogue.
Presenter: 53...  +++$+++  Barney: The number of nude photos that he has done before you realize he had no connection to Vogue.
Presenter: 22...  +++$+++  Barney: The age that you say you have.
Presenter: 31...  +++$+++  Barney: Your real age.
Presenter: 45...  +++$+++  Barney: The number of minutes for me to put in a taxi, get undressed and into my Jacuzzi.
Presenter: And the super bowl tonight is...  +++$+++  Barney: What happens after that is out of the jacuzzi. Great?
Robin: I went very confident. I knew it was just me against two other girls.  +++$+++  Barney: I listening.
Robin: I always ended up with a simple "all of us at Metro News One, have a great evening."  +++$+++  Barney: Mine: "From all of us in Barney's apartment, get out."
Robin: I will not be a presenter at Channel 10, right?  +++$+++  Barney: It just fell.
Marshall: If you think people liked your show, it's wrong...  +++$+++  Barney: Bizarre. Look at what is mixed with your fan mail.
Robin: What?  +++$+++  Barney: It comes from the Ministry of Immigration.
Robin: My work permit. If I can not find a job in the coming...seven days, they will refer me to Canada.  +++$+++  Barney: I can not believe you that turns the country.
Robin: Good question, Norm. For the first, I was an intern for Channel 22 in Red Deer. Alberta. In Canada. The snow falls hard enough, but these intrepid fishermen are still happy to contribute to the gathering of bass fishing Lake Athabasca, a tradition of 1 August To you, Norm. What? It was my first job. It shows where I come from.  +++$+++  Barney: Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo.
Lily: Obviously, the stirrups were too far apart during his last visit to the gynecologist.  +++$+++  Barney: Folks, sorry to stop you before Marshall falls into tears, but Robin, check it out. What you need is a super video resume. Like mine. I present to you: Barneysvideocv.com. Hello. Barney Stinson, you have achieved great successes in business, sport and personal relationships, and have been an inspiration to many people.
Ted: Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?  +++$+++  Barney: How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential?
Ted: And a little Scottish.  +++$+++  Barney: The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset.
Ted: You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?  +++$+++  Barney: And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit.
Lily: Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon.
Marshall: Really?  +++$+++  Barney: No, it would be... You listen? All my life I have dared to go beyond the possible. Until the impossible? In fact, beyond that... where the possible and the impossible meet to become... the possimpossible.
Lily: The possimpossible? Oh yeah?  +++$+++  Barney: Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision..."Visia-ness." If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible.  This guy is awesome.
Ted: It's you again...? You sing a song about you?  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely not. It would be stupid. Stinson, Barney Stinson singing this song, it would be really stupid. One of the fans who think this guy is awesome. Perfect and available.Great, Great, Great, Great, Great, Great... Great, great. Barney Stinson, committed. This jewel has earned me 11 jobs.
Lily: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Now, we talk about it.
Robin: What? I will be deported. I would try anything.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, we should get started. I have much to shoot, I can not use the tapes I have of you.
Robin: Bands on me?  +++$+++  Barney: Let's start.
Lily: I do not know how to answer that.  +++$+++  Barney: What does it mean to be a reporter for you?
Robin: Since I was little...  +++$+++  Barney: Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like "synergy" and "dynamism". You can invent a word, as... "Relationality."
Robin: How does make me feel stupid commit somewhere?  +++$+++  Barney: All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.
Robin: Rotate the camera. Connectitude.  +++$+++  Barney: I like it.
Robin: Transformatation.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on!
Robin: relationality.  +++$+++  Barney: relationality, this is mine.
Robin: These clothes are ridiculous. In addition, the armor of the amazon princess itch.  +++$+++  Barney: Showdown. You're not the first to wear it here. But it expresses the power. And that, too. Now, I need you break these 15 bricks with your forehead.
Robin: What? But you do anything in your video. You were right next to a horse and sitting on a motorcycle.  +++$+++  Barney: I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong.
Robin: I can not break 15 bricks with my forehead.  +++$+++  Barney: There is more in 1950. Yes, you can.
Robin: I'm off.  +++$+++  Barney: Why?
Robin: I remember the night before. They made me a farewell party. They gave me a camera to take pictures and send them home. Everyone was sure I will have much success. You will really miss.  +++$+++  Barney: What's the matter?
Ted: Robin must leave Canada.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God. It's horrible. It'll be along to commute.
Robin: What do you mean?  +++$+++  Barney: I've finished your video resume myself. I posted it to all channels of the city. A guy called from Channel 8. He adores you. He wants you to pass an audition.
Robin: My God!  +++$+++  Barney: I said no. Robin Scherbatsky do not audition. He is given the job or anything.
Robin: So, I have the job.  +++$+++  Barney: No. He cursed me and hung up. But after Channel 12, called. They'll love it too. They offer you to host their new talk show in the morning.
Robin: It's amazing!  +++$+++  Barney: I sent them sh1t.
Robin: Dude!  +++$+++  Barney: They want you even more. So they increased their offer by 10%. Congratulations. Looks like you'll have to stay.
Robin: How did you do that?  +++$+++  Barney: I am the master of possimpossible.
Marshall: Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.
Ted: That's ridiculous.  +++$+++  Barney: Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.
Ted: Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that "no" into a "yes."  +++$+++  Barney: Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?
Ted: Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.  +++$+++  Barney: You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.
Ted: You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?  +++$+++  Barney: Magic's not lame.
Ted: I don't get it. I mean...  +++$+++  Barney: Is this lame?
Lily: Barney...  +++$+++  Barney: I...
Lily: We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, but Ted provoked me.
Lily: No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.  +++$+++  Barney: But...
Ted: I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.  +++$+++  Barney: You can't turn a "no" into a "yes," Ted. Can't be done.
Robin: I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said "yes" eventually.  +++$+++  Barney: No, you didn't. You were like, "No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group."
Robin: To Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, right.
Ted: The receptionist. That's my way in.  +++$+++  Barney: I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.
Ted: That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?  +++$+++  Barney: Who?
Ted: I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.
Ted: No. I like Stella.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.
Ted: What do you mean?  +++$+++  Barney: I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.
Ted: What? What is it?  +++$+++  Barney: Hold on, I gotta pee.  Okay, I'm back. What's going on at work?
Ted: What's the big secret?!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh. Oh, right.
Barney: Oh. Oh, right.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.
Abby: Sure, what's it regarding?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like.
Abby: I-I don't understand.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!
Abby: Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying.  +++$+++  Barney: What are your credentials?!
Abby: Please don't do that. Please.  +++$+++  Barney: I want to know who am I speaking with!
Barney: I want to know who am I speaking with!  +++$+++  Barney: At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.
Ted: Folliculaphilia?  +++$+++  Barney: Folliculaphilia.
Ted: What is that?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.
Ted: That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.  +++$+++  Barney: You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.
Ted: Why? Just why?  +++$+++  Barney: Y-you don't remember?
Barney: Y-you don't remember?  +++$+++  Barney: I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.
Ted: You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?  +++$+++  Barney: I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.
Abby:...then he just kept toying with my emotions.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.
Abby: Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?
Abby: My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.  +++$+++  Barney: We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.
Abby: Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have s*x on it and then go shopping.  +++$+++  Barney: I like you.
Ted: As Barney's theory on world peace?  +++$+++  Barney: I explained. I said, Madeline, every international conflict essentially boils down to sexual tension.
Ted: All international conflicts?  +++$+++  Barney: All, man.
Ted: So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...  +++$+++  Barney: Gaza Strippers. Next.
Ted: Apartheid?  +++$+++  Barney: "Apartouze". You have what?
Ted: The Cold War?  +++$+++  Barney: "Mrs. Gorbachev, removed her underwear."
Marshall: Thank you, Lily.  +++$+++  Barney: You... have slept together. What are pouv...stouflant. Epouvstouflant. Well done, Ted. Bravo.
Robin: Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once.  +++$+++  Barney: So, I am responsible for... Excellent. Excellent.Excellent. The next tour is for me!
Lily: Are you okay?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes. Why you ask?
Lily: For one thing, you cry openly.  +++$+++  Barney: From joy. I am so happy for them.
Lily: Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute.  I'm going quite well.
Lily: You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait. If I pay a woman $ 200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe...
Marshall: I knew you had not of paddler!  +++$+++  Barney: Wonderful, we still speak of that!
Marshall: You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine. " But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, "magazine is read" is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, "read a magazine" that's wank, right?
Ted: This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.  +++$+++  Barney: Super.
Ted: This morning, she cried through the door, "You're too long in the shower! ". A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.  +++$+++  Barney: If great.
Ted: Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!  +++$+++  Barney: It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.
Barney: It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.  +++$+++  Barney: So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?
Seller: Okay, but CRTs have the deepest blacks.  +++$+++  Barney: So if I want a very good contrast ratio...
Seller: The deep structure of the CRT pixel resolution produces unrivaled in LCD.  +++$+++  Barney: I take the CRT.
Lily: Barney, it's crazy.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm fine, thank you.
Lily: No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. "The time for emotions", every Tuesday morning.  +++$+++  Barney: Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better.
Marshall: Do you have any?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man.
Ted: No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.  +++$+++  Barney: Clearly. This is the end.
Robin: What do I do?  +++$+++  Barney: A single solution. You must stop sleeping together, please.
Lily: What is your problem?  +++$+++  Barney : This one.
Marshall: It did not last long.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you.
Ted: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: Because of your bickering roommates are always a source of conflict between you two, I wanted to help. In fact, I went to the post. I took you stamps. In about 10 000. That should be enough.
Ted: Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?  +++$+++  Barney: I took it in passing. It's nothing.
Ted: You have bought us a dishwasher?  +++$+++  Barney: It has always been there. You've been here how long?
Ted: So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. I worry about you.
Ted: It bothers you that we sleep together, right?  +++$+++  Barney: Not at all. It's crazy. What?
Ted: You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.  +++$+++  Barney: What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?
Ted: Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.  +++$+++  Barney: I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus.
Ted: That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?  +++$+++  Barney: No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls.
Ted: Are you sure?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes!
Ted: Positive?  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely.
Barney: Absolutely.  +++$+++  Barney: And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke.
Lily: Get out of here.  +++$+++  Barney: But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division.
Lily: Who wants to do the coloring?  +++$+++  Barney: Great, it's Lily who sent you? I have not the bear, OK?I will make it! Why are you smiling?
Marshall: I just... reading a magazine. Here at work.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Magazine: Watch the road.  +++$+++  Barney: Congratulations.
Marshall: Thank you. I would have done well at some point.Sometimes you have to... You have to say and... go there.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I gotta go. In fact, there are toilets here, if you want to use.
Marshall:... Species  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, I must tell you the truth. I love...  tacos. What are you doing?
Robin: I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? That's Wife... vantable.
Robin: Epousvantable?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, it is pousvantable. What has happened?
Robin: He insisted. He said "no longer able to do" if "it hurt someone." I think we all know who he is talking about.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh?
Robin: It's not obvious?  +++$+++  Barney: It is?
Robin: Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of...  +++$+++  Barney: I love you.
Robin: Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?  +++$+++  Barney: A Taco?
Robin: You love them, right?  +++$+++  Barney: Just.
Ted: I never will. Every year, when the greeting card of Mosby happens...  +++$+++  Barney : Drop your trousers. Mine hard. Under the bunch of mistletoe, I'll make your sister moan. Oh! Dear Heather, Heather dear, we'll do it in all directions...
Barney : Drop your trousers. Mine hard. Under the bunch of mistletoe, I'll make your sister moan. Oh! Dear Heather, Heather dear, we'll do it in all directions...  +++$+++  Barney: If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. And fours.
Barney: If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. And fours.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted has a little sister who is so playful every day. And if I meet with her breasts, I will play! Little sister, Little Sister!What? I can also celebrate Hanukkah.
Ted: It's still him. I should answer. Hello, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi. What are you doing tonight?
Heather: Incredibly gay.  Dude, quail out there.  +++$+++  Barney: Why, hello. I was expecting you.
Ted: One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself?  +++$+++  Barney: I needed one that rotates.
Lily: Do not tell me anything! You know I can not keep secrets if it's almost Christmas! Robin offers you an iPod!  +++$+++  Barney: Can I talk to one second in the kitchen? Not touch the chair. I praise him. I can not believe that thou hast hid thy sister all these years.
Ted: Really? You're like "Weird Al" Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.  +++$+++  Barney: First, I'm flattered. Then it's just jokes. A friend can joke on a friend's sister. Does not mean I'm going to act.
Ted: I love my sister, and as a big brother, it's my job to protect guys like you.  +++$+++  Barney: You do not trust me?
Ted: No. And it either.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. All right. I'll just... take my chair and leave.
Ted: Wait... Rest... Back... Lily and I were dining out with Heather Sunday. Want to go?  +++$+++  Barney: I have already called to add a person.
Ted: You really can not tell Lily.  +++$+++  Barney: No, nothing really...
Marshall: Go. You're wrong.  +++$+++  Barney: I'll take the vichyssoise with a hint of cream. Dairy ballonnent me.
Ted: Let me think.  +++$+++  Barney: It, it means he will not.
Ted: We'll talk later, OK?  +++$+++  Barney: You do not have any illusions.
Ted: You're my sister.  +++$+++  Barney: There he just says the obvious.
Ted: I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. Do you need relationships. If only Ted knew someone who works at, say... Goliath National Bank, then...expect. What? I work for Goliath National Bank. Incredible!
Lily: My God!  +++$+++  Barney: Before you say or do something, give me a favor.
Lily: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Move away. It's a Prada.
Robin: Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!  +++$+++  Barney: I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position.
Lily: This is the new coasters?  +++$+++  Barney: I hope you get the job. Nothing makes me happier than to fill an opening.
Ted: OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!  +++$+++  Barney: You've sneaked?
Ted: Come on. Lily saw you.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh yeah?
Barney: Oh yeah?  +++$+++  Barney: You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather...
Heather:... That we decided to show you what you expect from us.  +++$+++  Barney: And as we can count on Lily to sneak.
Heather: Because you deserve it.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe.
Heather: You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas.  +++$+++  Barney: Your mother and I, we kissed.
Ted: We'll have to go elsewhere. In this bar, I will always be the guy left at the altar. It sucks!  +++$+++  Barney: Good times.
Lily: There's a girl there in a sweater wrap. He does not listen to a word they say. Hein, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Leave me alone!
Ted: He understood, there is little time, he could hold a conversation with just the titles of sitcoms "black" of the 70s and 80s.  +++$+++  Barney: What's going on?
Lily: Barney, you wanna go and get my stuff does not Marshall?  +++$+++  Barney: Diff'rent Strokes.
Ted : Doug Martin was in McClaren's bartender. He was always in the corner.  +++$+++  Barney: You... Been to Ted?
Ted: It is not play "You know Ted."  +++$+++  Barney : I'm dead?  I'm dead?  Tonight... I am a lesbian.
Doug: We're going down the aisle and fight with these guys.  +++$+++  Barney: What's going on?
Ted: A fight. We gotta go?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I would fight for three things, the closing of a stubborn bra, accusations of sexual harassment... 9 of 9! And wanted to vomit when I see someone wearing brown shoes with a black suit.
Robin: No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties.  +++$+++  Barney: I lost my wisdom tooth. Without surgery. Local anesthesia. Frankly, it's nothing.
Marshall: My brothers.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, it was surely the ruckus in the playroom of Eriksen.
Ted: Oh yeah? I seem to remember that this guy was well dumped by his girlfriend for a Taekwondo teacher. It might sound crazy, but... I need that. I think it's an experience I do. I go there.  +++$+++  Barney: Me too!  Guys... watch what face. The next time you see it, it will be distorted as the sexiest possible. Because that's what I am: a real man. I like to fight and do battle in the dirt. You find me a wooden hanger for that?
Barney: Me too!  Guys... watch what face. The next time you see it, it will be distorted as the sexiest possible. Because that's what I am: a real man. I like to fight and do battle in the dirt. You find me a wooden hanger for that?  +++$+++  Barney: It's been what?
Ted: He thinks he fought with him.  +++$+++  Barney: We fought with him. So we will go and tell everyone the legendary story of how we beat types. And everyone will find it great and everyone goes back to bed with me.
Ted: Come on man, no one will believe we fought, we look at.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, it's good...
Ted: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: What I should have done there is a lease.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: I dunno, I typed the eye! I even know what I say! I have a great right, either. You ready?
Ted: To go home?  +++$+++  Barney: No, for that.
Ted: You hit me in the nose!  +++$+++  Barney: Are you crying?
Ted: Yes, I cry! You hit me in the nose!  +++$+++  Barney: It's going to swell to death. You're going to look like Owen Wilson. Come on, we go.

Woman 1: So you've just beaten?  +++$+++  Barney: Just?
Ted: Amanda, was it that simple? You know, the fight in melee, it is more than using force against his opponent, huh B?  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly!
Woman 2: But I do not understand, what they did to deserve this?  +++$+++  Barney: It may seem insignificant, but they got to our table.
Ted: At our table.  +++$+++  Barney: And...
Ted: No one.  +++$+++  Barney:... no one sits at our table.
Amanda: You will beat them up?  +++$+++  Barney: Let's beat them up. Ted, come on. You two. Our table.Go. Now!
Ted: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: Relax, it was Doug. Doug supports us.
Ted: He's not here tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: I offer you what? A drink? Money? These two girls over there?
Male 2: And you're Barney Stinson?  +++$+++  Barney: They know who you are. All right, guys. It lets you go without kick your ass. This time. Okay?
Man 1: You are charged with assault. Enjoy it.  +++$+++  Barney: That was close.
Ted: Assault! They continue to attack us!  +++$+++  Barney: What is the penalty for assault? I'll have a fine?Picking up garbage on the highway? Because I already did that.

Ted : I have not told them what had really happened.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, I'm hot. Let's go. What has happened?
Robin: Just 10,000 glasses. No matter how long it takes.  +++$+++  Barney: You can not measure something like that in a while. It is step by step. From his bed at the front door. Bam! You're outside. Next!
Ted: Two out of three. He assured me.  +++$+++  Barney: Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers.

Lily: Why?
Barney: No, I said, "Guess who?"
Lily:  I heard you.
Robin: Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?
Marshall: What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?
Barney: Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?

Marshall: Barney, why are we here?
Barney: Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.
Marshall: Thanks, man.
Barney: You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.
Marshall: Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?
Barney: Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.

Ted : Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time.

IN. STRIP CLUB
A striper comes up to Marshall.
Marshall: Married!
Barney: What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.
Marshall: I do! It's just not that easy.
Barney: False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.
Marshall: Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.
**MARSHALL'S FANTASY**
Lily starts to hiccup. Marshall took her to the hospital.
Doctor:  Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate.
Marshall : What?! How could this be?!
Doctor: Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.
6 months later, Lily is still in the hospital.
Lily: It's time, baby.
Marshall: I will never love again.
Lily: No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.
Then she dies.
At the funeral, the priest speaks.
Priest: And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.
And after an appropriate number of years, someone knocks at the door.
Delivery girl: Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.
Marshall:  This one's for you Lily.  Where do I sign?
**END OF FANTASY**
Marshall: And then watch out, because it is on!
Barney: That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.
Marshall: It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.
Barney: I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.
Voice: Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine.
The striper looks like Lily.
Marsahll: Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?
Barney, excited, calls Ted on the phone.
Barney: Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!
Ted:  Yeah, I can't talk right now.
Barney: I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!
Marshall: Stop looking at her.
Ted: Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.
Barney: Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.
Marshall:  I'll kill you!

Ted:  Sorry about that.
Jen: So, any thoughts on food?
**2002**
Ted: Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?
Jen: I would love to share the oysters.
Ted:  Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.
Jen: Wow, that's bad.
Ted: That's why it's funny!
**2009**
Ted and Jen: We've been on this date before.
Ted: We've been on this exact blind date before.
Jen: In this exact same restaurant.
Ted: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.
Jen: Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby.
Ted: Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.
Jen: They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.
Ted: Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.
Jen: Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?
Ted: Well, you've got your cats.
They chuckle.
Jen: This is insane.
Ted: Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?
Jen: Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... 
**2002**
Ted laughs, reading the menu.
Ted: Main Lobster. They spelled "Maine" without the "e." Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...
Jen: I get it, Ted.
**2009**
Jen: Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.
Ted: Huh. I had no idea.
Jen: Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?
Ted: That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.
**2002**
The waiter brings the check. Ted takes it and Jen don't even look at it.
**2009**
Ted ; Guys want to wave the girl off and, you know, look like a big shot.
Jen: Huh. I had no idea.
Ted: This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.
Jen: We really are. Okay, I'm in.
Ted: Great.
Jen: Where'd we go next?
Ted: I think we went to MacLaren's.
Jen: Okay.
They rise up.
Jen: Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?
**2002**
Jen: And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.
**2009**
Jen: Tone down the kitty talk. Check.
They leave the restaurant.

Ted: All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.
Jen: Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.
**2002**
Jen: It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?
Ted: Not really.
Jen: Really? I can't feel my fingers.
Ted: I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.
**2009**
Ted: I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.
**2002**
Jen: After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.
Ted: I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.
**2002**
Jen: Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?
Ted: See? Why didn't you lead off with that?

IN. MC LAREN'S
Lily: Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.
Barney: See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.
Robin: I'm not cool with it.
Barney: Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.
Robin: It's disgusting.
Barney: Because it's harmless.
Robin: Did one of your whores tell you that?
Barney: And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.
Lily: Trouble? What trouble?
Marshall: It's, no, it's nothing.
Barney: Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.
Robin: No, we're not.
Marshall: Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.
Lily: You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!
Marshall: Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.

Ted: Remember? 
Jen: Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.
Ted: You loved them.
Jen: They're family, Ted.
Ted: Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly "can't think" of anything I do wrong.

Robin: Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check
Lily: Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.
Marshall: Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!
Jen: Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.
Ted: Me?
All the other: Ted?
Jen: Yeah. We were all sitting over there... 
**2002**
Jen: And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...
Lily: What about Cat Woman?
Jen: Yeah, that would've been good.
Barney: Psst! Ted! 
Ted:  Nice.
**2009**
Ted: Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.
**2002**
Barney ; Psst, Ted. 
Ted: Nice.
**2009**
Ted: We were checking out Moustache Marshall.
The other: Ah...
Jen: Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.
Ted: Yeah, well, it's nice to know "past me" wasn't a total jackass, huh?
Jen: "Present you" isn't so bad, either.

Jen: Thank you very much.
Ted: You got it.
Jen: Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.
**2002**
Ted: ...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.
Jen: Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.
Ted: Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best
first date of all time, but, uh, I'm glad we stuck it out.
Jen: Me, too.
They kiss.
**2009**
Ted: That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?
Jen: I remember now.
**2002**
Jen:  Wow.
Ted: Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?
Jen: Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?
Ted: Absolutely.
Jen: Promise?
Ted: Promise.
**2009**
Ted: I have been so busy.
Jen: Good night, Ted.
She's leaving when her phone rings.
Jen: Hello?
Ted: Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.
Jen: Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.

IN. MC LAREN's
Lily: Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, killing me off.
Marhsall: I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and s*x. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.
Lily: All right, we got to fix this.

IN. STRIP CLUB
Lily: Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.
Marshall: Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.
Lily: Bring out Stripper Lily!
Barney:  You know, I don't come here that much.
Waitress: Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching.
Barney: Thank you, kindly stranger.
Voice: Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine.
Jasmine starts her show.
Lily: I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?
Marshall: That was a hundred?
Lily: Wow, she crawls fast.

Ted: Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.
Jen: The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.
Ted: No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what
would have happened?
Ted imagines: She wants to pay the restaurant. He offers her his jacket. They takes pictures with Moustache Marshall. He calls her after their date. They marry.
Jen: Wow.
Marshall: Wow.

Barney: You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.
Robin: I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.
Barney: Just the best.
Marshall: Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.
Barney: Just the best.

Jen: ... now what?
Ted: I just remembered why I didn't call you.
Jen: Why?
Ted: I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.
Jen: What?
Ted: And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.
Jen: Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.
Ted: Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?
Jen: Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.
Ted: Well... good luck out there, Jen.
Jen: You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.
Ted : And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.

Marshall:  Lily!  +++$+++  Barney: Guess who just got four tickets to the "Origins of Chewbacca" Star Wars exhibit?
Lily: Why?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I said, "Guess who?"
Marshall: What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?  +++$+++  Barney: Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?
Marshall: Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.  +++$+++  Barney: We're not going to the "Origins of Chewbacca" exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.
Ted: Wait a second, the "Origins of Chewbacca" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?  +++$+++  Barney: My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.
Marshall: Barney, why are we here?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.
Marshall: Thanks, man.  +++$+++  Barney: You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.
Marshall: Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?  +++$+++  Barney: Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.
Marshall: Married!  +++$+++  Barney: What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.
Marshall: I do! It's just not that easy.  +++$+++  Barney: False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.
Marshall: And then watch out, because it is on!  +++$+++  Barney: That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.
Marshall: It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.  +++$+++  Barney: I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.
Marsahll: Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!
Ted:  Yeah, I can't talk right now.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!
Ted: Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.

Ted: There he is.  +++$+++  Barney : You there, what's your name?
Woman: Excuse me?  +++$+++  Barney : Your name, woman, what's your name?
Barney : Your name, woman, what's your name?  +++$+++  Barney : I knew it. You are "the" Cindy, one that can change everything and bring us to our downfall. Listen to me, Cindy. I am Barney Stinson, and I have an urgent mission from the future.
Cindy: From the future?  +++$+++  Barney : The future, and I can prove it to you. In exactly four seconds, the woman at this table will slap this man.
Ted: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight.
Cindy: You mean what?  +++$+++  Barney : I have not the time to explain. I must return to reality accelerator before the vortex closes. Only you can save us, Cindy. I must go!
Ted: Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?  +++$+++  Barney: Vive la vodka.
Cindy: My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?  +++$+++  Barney: I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on.
Cindy: Global warming?  +++$+++  Barney: My God! How do you know that?
Ted: It's good enough!  +++$+++  Barney: It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!
Stewart: Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all.  +++$+++  Barney: This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!
Stewart: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?
Marshall: It's true. We live.  +++$+++  Barney: You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?
Lily: We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Lily: Specifically, those with fire.  +++$+++  Barney: The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage!  Thanks! Oh, sh1t.
Ted: What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?  +++$+++  Barney : Yes! In the mouth! You said that the "Barney the future" work out. You told me I was crazy. My shrink told me I was crazy. Which is the narcissist with severe emotional disorders, Dr. Grossbard? A banner of intervention?That's what?
Ted: Stella.  +++$+++  Barney: "I can not remain indifferent... "
Ted: You kept it on you?  +++$+++  Barney: Please. "I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... "Flames! Oh, sh1t! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, "glass half full", but I think they become beasts.
Marshall: Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.  +++$+++  Barney: I meet this challenge.
Marshall: What challenge?  +++$+++  Barney: Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.
Ted: I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!  +++$+++  Barney : Good evening, young lady. You want a caramel?What do you mean, "nothing in common"? We're both older.
Woman: You're cute. How old are you?  +++$+++  Barney: 83 years. How old are you?
Ted: Oh, my God!  +++$+++  Barney: I think someone owes me $ 200.
Marshall: Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...  +++$+++  Barney : This proves that I will be as great as that when I have 80 years. Tope my arthritis.
Ted: Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?  +++$+++  Barney : You mean great? I am 80 years old guy, and I pack a girl of 22 years.
Woman: Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World War II.  +++$+++  Barney : In an instant my child.
Marshall: Okay, it matters not.  +++$+++  Barney : What? Why?
Robin: Amazing.  +++$+++  Barney: It's amazing.
Marshall: Not at all.  +++$+++  Barney: I would much Red Bull.
Ted: Good idea. I have the tape.  +++$+++  Barney : What...?
Robin: Barney is an intervention.  +++$+++  Barney : Sorry, I hear you.
Marshall: That's enough, the trick of "old."  +++$+++  Barney : The trick in the middle?
Lily: Forget it.  +++$+++  Barney : Leave baby? I love this old rhyme!
Ted: I will get my problem.  +++$+++  Barney: You're going to get my boat?
Ted: But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world.  +++$+++  Barney: There are two students out, and they look easy!
Ted: Arizona... You know... I always wanted to see what looks like a license in Arizona.  +++$+++  Barney: I already did that. 21 years.
Ted: You have a group? We will perhaps see you.  +++$+++  Barney: Excuse me one second.  What is your problem? We will not see them play.
Ted: Why?  +++$+++  Barney: If you go see them, it is not better than blondes showing their tits at a concert by Van Halen.
Ted: Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?  +++$+++  Barney: If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required.
Ted: We are their fathers?  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly.  This is a great meeting, I think that we can come. Another time, girls.
Ted: If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers.  +++$+++  Barney: Excuse us a minute.  Have you gone crazy? We do not want their numbers.
Ted: I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.  +++$+++  Barney: Qua na you exchange a number, you give him the opportunity to call to cancel. If you give a number without an appointment, they must come. Checkmate! No number, just my fingers. Truck.
Ted: You're still their father?  +++$+++  Barney: Why not arrange to meet you here tomorrow night to 22h.
Woman 1: I think it will snow. What do we do if there is a blizzard?  +++$+++  Barney: Whatever happens, we will be there.
Ted: That's all "ski" account.  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry one last time.
Ted: What is the problem here?  +++$+++  Barney: Well done.
Ted: Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney: At tomorrow night.
Woman 1: Great!  +++$+++  Barney: 'Definitely. Great! "Dude, these students seem stupid.
Ted: Bluntly.  +++$+++  Barney: Awesome. Here's the thing: tomorrow night, dress up well, it will move!
Ted: We would still have had to make their numbers.  +++$+++  Barney: You always imagine the worst. Ted, I promise, everything will be okay. It begins to snow.
Ted: It's really bad outside. They will not.  +++$+++  Barney: But if it will come. It has to. If I can touch one of those girls, I get a "Bingo party student." Come on, Ted. You're the only one here.
Ted: Sorry, a "Bingo party student"?  +++$+++  Barney: Every year, Playboy publishes a list of the best student parties in the country. I take the top 25, and I do... a bingo card. All I need now that Arizona Tech, which is crazy. In a contest, it would be given automatically.
Ted: How many people are on this festive bingo student?  +++$+++  Barney: Just me.
Ted: What is the purpose then?  +++$+++  Barney: The goal is to make it five in a row.
Ted: And you got what, if you succeed?  +++$+++  Barney: I have a bingo.
Ted: No! It is only 21h.  +++$+++  Barney: And it rocks here, yo!
Carl: I'm really sorry, but I have to install beds in the church. It becomes a refuge, snowy nights.  +++$+++  Barney: selfish b*st*rd! There are two cannons girls who come to us here.
Carl: You two? Impossible. You ignore the low bar.  +++$+++  Barney: Serve the guns first?
Ted: There should be a bar.  +++$+++  Barney: Of course, we should have a bar!
Ted: You really should have a bar.  +++$+++  Barney: It really should have a bar.
Ted: Our bar would be great.  +++$+++  Barney: And dude, dude, dude, dude... The name of our bar will be... Puzzles. People will, "Why Puzzles? "That's the puzzle.
Ted: That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap.  +++$+++  Barney: No nightcap!
Ted: Except where everyone ended up spending the best night of his life, then we put the chairs on the tables and pulled out the margarita fountain.  +++$+++  Barney: There should be a bar.
Ted: Barman. Triple Sec.  +++$+++  Barney: It happens, keep tap. We will buy one.
Ted: Served.  +++$+++  Barney: Served.
Woman 1: Reminds me of when I was sledding with my father... before he leaves.  +++$+++  Barney: And prem's.
Woman 1: It is the intention of getting drunk. Really get drunk.As my father did.  +++$+++  Barney: Prem's, prem's prem's.
Ted: There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.  +++$+++  Barney: Is there anything in a gin and tonic? There's what in a gin and tonic?
Ted: Hold a bar, it sucks. Is closed.  +++$+++  Barney: No nightcap!  Puzzles, Barney here.
Carl: Well, you're still there. I arrive in 5 minutes.  +++$+++  Barney: Last glass.
Robin: Do it.  Now, go find your wife.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me.
Ted: We said no last drink. We must do.  +++$+++  Barney: We should do what? Carl will be there from one moment to another.
Ted: Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.  +++$+++  Barney: We should start a band.
Man: Guys, this festival is great! You are true friends of Hens fighting. If necessary, do not hesitate to ask.  +++$+++  Barney: The flute section does she see anyone?
Woman: This is a great band name. Have you seen Amanda?  +++$+++  Barney: Bingo!
Ted: That's it. This is the problem.  +++$+++  Barney: Her ass?
Ted: There will always be a bag. Even if it goes well, it ends one day by spoiling.  +++$+++  Barney: Once in 30 years.
Ted: When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over.  +++$+++  Barney: Please, tell me you repliest not emotional baggage.
Ted: It's a good thing?  +++$+++  Barney: The emotional baggage is the foundation of American cultural export the most important.
All: The p0rn.  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, the p0rn. Only women with major baggage make p0rn.
Marshall: Certainly not.  +++$+++  Barney: On the great grandmother.
Marshall: It's normal.  +++$+++  Barney: There is a street where it's normal. One clue: a giant yellow bird lives on.
Ted: I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.  +++$+++  Barney: Gentile? This is the worst baggage. The best: she hates her father, and she believes to be big, but no. Steamy s*x at first date, and have brekky, she left. Why are you with me?
Tony: The code.  +++$+++  Barney: That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.
Royce: Ted?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted?
Ted: I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.  +++$+++  Barney: To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?
Ted: What...  +++$+++  Barney: I wanted... People want to know.
Royce: All I wanted was some pancakes this week.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, darling, kiss him.
Man: You must go!  +++$+++  Barney: This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!
Royce: Bluntly, doll.  +++$+++  Barney: Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.
Ted : The next three days, I worked as ever. And it led me... nowhere.  +++$+++  Barney: What are you doing?
Ted: A hat-shaped building.  +++$+++  Barney: It's time to talk?
Ted: No.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you think of Robin?
Ted: I have to really work, so...  +++$+++  Barney: Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume.
Ted: Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.  +++$+++  Barney: But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?
Ted: I'm with you.  +++$+++  Barney: Now. For I have explained.
Ted : I should explain. A few years earlier...  +++$+++  Barney: Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks.
Marshall: It looks to be a... sacred... spa.  +++$+++  Barney: Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump?
Ted : But he did not jump.  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, it's not bad.
Marshall: This is the permission I needed.  +++$+++  Barney: Look, Robin... I must tell you something.
Robin: Wait. Before that, I must tell you something.  +++$+++  Barney: What is it?
Ted : When Aunt Lily a farmer invited to speak to his class how he brought the goat, and told the class what he would do later. How Aunt Lily, in a fit of kindness, bought a goat to commute his sentence.  +++$+++  Barney: It's been an incredible thing. I was talking to Robin, I would tell him my feelings, but just before, you will believe what ever she said.
Lily: You said what?  +++$+++  Barney: In your opinion? What we can say to that?
Barney: In your opinion? What we can say to that?  +++$+++  Barney: Robin, you're great listening. You're really great, but we're friends. This is not a good idea.
Robin: You must be right. Have fun.  +++$+++  Barney: You too, sweetie.
Lily: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Once she told me that, more than feelings. I'm more in love.
Lily: You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more.  +++$+++  Barney: It's not great?
Marshall: It is. It... is... go! It is.  +++$+++  Barney: Tracey, tell Lily what you just said.
Tracey: What I just arrived in New York?  +++$+++  Barney: No, how you've arrived there.
Tracey: I just get off the bus from Iowa.  +++$+++  Barney: Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?
Lily: Honey, you're there. You're really there.  +++$+++  Barney: You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?
Lily: Damn.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Lily: Everyone always says, "Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. "And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!  +++$+++  Barney: What song? There was a piece?
Lily: There was a song.  +++$+++  Barney: The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?
Ted: I'm with you.  +++$+++  Barney: Now. As I explained...
Marshall: You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts.  +++$+++  Barney: So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise.
Lily: That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great.  So Robin does not like me.
Lily: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Why?
Marshall: You got beat by a girl.  +++$+++  Barney: So... You're in love with me?
Robin: What? Yes. Much.  +++$+++  Barney: You can stop. Lily told me everything.
Robin: Damn, Lily!  +++$+++  Barney: I can not believe it.
Robin: It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same.
Robin: Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, "stifles it in the bud" because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: It's going pretty fast, do not you think?
Robin: What?  +++$+++  Barney: We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?
Robin: Friends.  +++$+++  Barney: My God. You just do it again. You've mosbys!
Robin: But no.  +++$+++  Barney: But if, little flirtatious.
Robin: You're right. I've just mosbyser.  +++$+++  Barney: Why are you scared to try?
Robin: Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.  +++$+++  Barney: Bad idea.
Robin: You're right. There must be a mistake.  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Robin: I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: Friends.
Robin: Friends, then.  +++$+++  Barney: I love you.
Robin: Let's get married.  +++$+++  Barney: No, you're smothering me.
Robin: OK, forget it.  +++$+++  Barney: You know what? We'll see later.
Marshall: I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, right.
Marshall: Pretty radar chest. This is my wife.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I must go.
Lily: Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type?  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going.
Marshall: Now that you say, Barney did something weird yesterday at the office.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, to Saturday.  I was thinking of a brunch, and perhaps a hike. I love you too.
Lily: You think it is possible that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend?  +++$+++  Barney: A plus.
Lily: Wait. Where are you going?  +++$+++  Barney: Nowhere. At the beach. It's winter. Laser Tag. At home. Shut up! It is you who are going somewhere.
Ted: He stops.  +++$+++  Barney: What are you doing here?
Lily: Where is she?  +++$+++  Barney: Who?
Lily: Your girlfriend. You did not really like, huh?  +++$+++  Barney: These are my friends. Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin.Guys, here is Loretta. My mother.
Robin: You call your mother every day?  +++$+++  Barney: Mom!
Lily: So that's what we hide you? You did not want people to know that you're a momma's boy.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, you got me. I guess you can leave.
Woman: Who are these people?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin. I present to you Betty... my wife. And my son, Tyler.
Betty: But forget, one meatloaf, after what was said Dr. Grossbard on your cholesterol.  +++$+++  Barney: She wants me to live long.
Betty: Guilty. I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: Me too.
Tyler: Me-seven!  +++$+++  Barney: Will in, little rascal! I'll see you at the bar?
Robin: What's that, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price.
Marshall: Bob Barker is your father.  +++$+++  Barney: She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill.
Barney: She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill.  +++$+++  Barney: I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged.
Barney: I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged.  +++$+++  Barney: I hired an actress to play my girlfriend "Betty". His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.

I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.  +++$+++  Barney: You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished.
Betty: I'm pregnant!  +++$+++  Barney: And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep "Betty" and make a casting to find my son, Tyler.
Lily: It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?  +++$+++  Barney: For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition.
Barney: For a while, it was enough to borrow / keep the baby from neighbors. And once at Christmas, my mother was drunk at the grog, I went out with a bag of flour and a Chucky mask.But eventually I had to audition.  +++$+++  Barney: four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave.
Woman: You said if I slept with you, my son would have the role.  +++$+++  Barney: Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!
Barney: Apparently I'm better actor than your son. Bring those from 11!  +++$+++  Barney: And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant.
Ted: Come on, Grant looks pretty good.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?
Grant: Yes?  +++$+++  Barney: You see? This is amateur work. Believe me, the child stars had better possession in the 80s.
Marshall: It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.  +++$+++  Barney: Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat.
Lily: Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily.
Marshall: You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.  +++$+++  Barney: No, no question. The truth would kill her.
Lily: Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: On the bed "race car"?
Tyler: Meatloaf? Tyler to love!  +++$+++  Barney: We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!
Grant: But it's funny.  +++$+++  Barney: I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.
Robin: Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?  +++$+++  Barney: Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.
Betty: And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.  +++$+++  Barney: The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!
Betty: You better stop!  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.
Loretta: And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?  +++$+++  Barney: Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?
Tyler: Well...  +++$+++  Barney: Page 4...
Marshall: Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.  +++$+++  Barney: Tyler said: "In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. "
Loretta: It was cute.  +++$+++  Barney: We're a happy family.
Loretta: I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.  +++$+++  Barney: No weak link in this scene. Bravo!
Marshall: You can stop with that?  +++$+++  Barney: Go and eat your ice.
Grant: I can not. I'm lactose intolerant.  +++$+++  Barney: Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite.
Loretta: It's time for ice!  +++$+++  Barney: Yum!
Tyler: Tyler dislike.  +++$+++  Barney: You're not gonna get us out a slogan.
Loretta: I do not understand.  +++$+++  Barney: I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep!
Tyler: I do not want my mom and dad divorced!  +++$+++  Barney: What can you have to say for yourself?
Ted: Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry. What?
Ted: November 14, 1998. The night train to Monte Carlo. I was in the car pool arnaquant Algerians few thousand dinars, while thou sduisais my bride! Who is blind and took you for me.  +++$+++  Barney: For God's sake, what are you talking?
Ted: You know not well what I mean?  +++$+++  Barney: No, not at all.
Ted: Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!  +++$+++  Barney: Mom, you leave us a moment?
Loretta: There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows.  +++$+++  Barney: You've lost your mind?
Ted: Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.  +++$+++  Barney: What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?
Loretta: Honey, you okay?  +++$+++  Barney: Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over.
Loretta: My God!  +++$+++  Barney: None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.
Loretta: What?  +++$+++  Barney: I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom.
Loretta: Well, Betty is not your wife?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Loretta: thank you God! I do not like this woman.  +++$+++  Barney: Really?
Loretta: Yes. And Tyler... I know I am his grandmother and I'm supposed to love him, but I hate him. "Tyler not love! "What does that mean?  +++$+++  Barney: Is it not?
Loretta: With your fake friends over there, I wanted to shoot myself.  +++$+++  Barney: I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me?
Loretta: I'm confused. I do not know why you thought having to do that. I love you, perfect family or not. I love you, no matter what.  +++$+++  Barney: Really?
Loretta: Really.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you.
Loretta: Whatever. I love you always.  +++$+++  Barney: Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do.
Loretta: When you were 3 years old, I left you with a babysitter and spent three weeks with Grand Funk Railroad, from one guy to another like a bang.  +++$+++  Barney: Mom!
Robin: The taxi is here.  +++$+++  Barney: I'll try.
Marshall: That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?  +++$+++  Barney: Nope!
Ted: Who do you like in Die Hard?  +++$+++  Barney: Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character.
Lily: OK, and Breakfast Club?  +++$+++  Barney: The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit.
Robin: I have one. Terminator.  +++$+++  Barney: What is the title, Robin? Who among us has not shed a tear when his small red eye goes to the end and he can not kill these people? Sorry. The film...
Ted: I'll watch the film again with you.  +++$+++  Barney: They even try to help!
Ted: The addicts who have not sold their TV?  +++$+++  Barney: The strippers in this weird time between work and waking the children?
Marshall: You know, as usual.  +++$+++  Barney: Really, as usual.? Think the funniest thing that ever happened.
Robin: It's good.  +++$+++  Barney: And twice that.
Robin: So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?  +++$+++  Barney: Something even funnier happened to Marshall today.
Lily: What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue.  +++$+++  Barney: I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl.
Lily: Karen is here?  +++$+++  Barney: You're kidding me!
Marshall: This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid.  +++$+++  Barney: So far. Tells the story, tells the story!
Robin: Wait. It's really funny?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny.
Marshall: I searched my bag to get my stuff working...  +++$+++  Barney: Wait. Expect. I want to say.
Marshall: Okay. Say it.  +++$+++  Barney: He searched his bag to get his stuff, and... No, say it.It's more fun if you say so. Let me say it. No, say it. You say.Say it. At the same time. No, go ahead.
Marshall: I forgot...  +++$+++  Barney: He forgot his pants!
Barney: He forgot his pants!  +++$+++  Barney: He forgot his pants.
Robin: She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?  +++$+++  Barney: Respect.
Lily: Are you kidding!  +++$+++  Barney: The pants!
Marshall: Why do you want to lunch with an ex?  +++$+++  Barney: Good question, there are four reasons for a "meal ex '.1: They want to get back together.
Scooter: Why? You like the servers? I can be a waiter. I will become the best server in the world, and you'll love me!  +++$+++  Barney: 2: They want to kill you. As my lunch with Wendy.
Wendy: Happy is that way at last. You know, after you have rejected nine times, I almost drop.  +++$+++  Barney: But you did not do it, you've continued to insist.
Wendy: Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you.  +++$+++  Barney: Gun! She's got a gun!
Wendy: It's a tie!  +++$+++  Barney: 3: They make you really want your business.
Curt: We did well to break.  +++$+++  Barney: Or four: You taunt with their success.
Robin: How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal.  +++$+++  Barney: And a hug is like a hug in public.
Robin: The pants.  +++$+++  Barney: The pants! The pants!
Marshall: It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell us, what was this concern?
Lily: Ted, you're not going out so easily. While the history of pants is fun...  +++$+++  Barney: Fun? Rather, very fun.
Marshall: You did what?  +++$+++  Barney: How could you?
Karen: I'll have a beer. You want one? A beer. I decanted Bordeaux.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, that's for sure, it's fun to look back when you were a farm girl fresh complexion and a virgin. But all that stuff... Ohio, Karen, in college... it was A.S. "Before Stinson." Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your skills are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?
Marshall: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Pant, pant...
Marshall: Okay! Lily came to the office to bring me my pants...  +++$+++  Barney: Why she did this?
Marshall: Because I forgot.  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, what are you doing here?
Lily: I just give something to Marshall.  +++$+++  Barney: He "give" something. Understood. Nice.
Lily: But I'm in a hurry. I can give it to you?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course, yes.
Lily: And you give him?  +++$+++  Barney: Wait. I do not know. Yours had better be really good.
Lily: What are you talking?  +++$+++  Barney: What about you?
Lily: Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.  +++$+++  Barney: He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has.
Ted: And you did not give him.  +++$+++  Barney: Theodore Evelyn Mosby. Of course I gave him. I gave him my word. It is concrete. For cons, I made a few alterations.
Man: Auditions for Oliver Twist are down!  +++$+++  Barney: Please, can I have more... pants?
Barney: Please, can I have more... pants?  +++$+++  Barney: More...
Marshall: It shows my calves.  +++$+++  Barney: The pants. Still tells.
Ted: "Judy duty."  +++$+++  Barney: She said "doody."
Ted: Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.
Robin: How?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?
Ted: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.  +++$+++  Barney: Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.
Ted: What about animals?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!
Trey: Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding!  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.
Ted: Yeah! This video is entitled, "Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can." I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.  +++$+++  Barney &amp; Ted: Oh!
Barney &amp; Ted: Oh!  +++$+++  Barney: See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...
Ted:...right in the nuts,  +++$+++  Barney &amp; Ted: The fat kid just runs away.
Marshall: This is worse than the pork chop.  +++$+++  Barney: This next clip is entitled, "Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull"
Ted: Let's see what happens.  +++$+++  Barney: Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.
Ted: And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.  +++$+++  Barney: Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.
Ted: She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. All those "famous last word" people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?
Nathan Hale: My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country.  +++$+++  Barney: You know what his real last words were?
Nathan Hale: I'm peeing my pants!  +++$+++  Barney: True story.
Robin: Hey, stay hydrated.  +++$+++  Barney: So?
Lily: We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.  +++$+++  Barney: It doesn't. That's true.
Everyone: Yes.  +++$+++  Barney: Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called "German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink."
Robin: Whoa, they grow big out here.  +++$+++  Barney: And here's your phone number back.
Ted: Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.
Ted: Stupid.  +++$+++  Barney: What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.
Judy: "You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive."  +++$+++  Barney, his voice breaking: Lame.
Lily: Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?  +++$+++  Barney: She's right. Your dad was hilarious.
Robin: Hi, Dad.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad.
Woman: Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try.  +++$+++  Barney: Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue.
Robin: You know, the celebrities, they like really weird s*x stuff. Believe me.  +++$+++  Barney: How do you know that?
Marshall: Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.  +++$+++  Barney: But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.
Robin: As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.
Lily: I do not even know of Canadian s*x act.  +++$+++  Barney: You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police.
Lily: How do you know that?  +++$+++  Barney: Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite.
Marshall: Point org?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.
Ted: I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?  +++$+++  Barney: It is said? It should.
Marshall: No. I want to.  +++$+++  Barney: There's been no light.
Marshall: Tell him, you're his best friend.  +++$+++  Barney: No, it's you.
Marshall: No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.  +++$+++  Barney: White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.
Ted: I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.  +++$+++  Barney: You should leave the project.
Marshall: It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.  +++$+++  Barney: It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...
Ted: Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.  +++$+++  Barney: It's funny you mention the project. Because...
Ted: Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.  +++$+++  Barney: What was that?
Marshall: I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.  +++$+++  Barney: You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.
Marshall: But if I can.  +++$+++  Barney: Lie to me, there.
Marshall: I have a spaceship.  +++$+++  Barney: What kind of fuel?
Marshall: I have no spaceship.  +++$+++  Barney: But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.
Marshall: It is what color?  +++$+++  Barney: When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.
Marshall: Not at all.  +++$+++  Barney: You've been slow.
Robin: No.  +++$+++  Barney: Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.
Ted: Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.
Marshall: Good job.  +++$+++  Barney: All right!
Marshall: When you played third base for the softball team GNB.  +++$+++  Barney: There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.
Ted: False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?
Ted: Super. Very funny.  +++$+++  Barney: Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.
Ted: Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?  +++$+++  Barney: Nice shirt.
Ted: If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?  +++$+++  Barney: This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.
Ted: Wait, what is a P.T.E.?  +++$+++  Barney: Room for Transitional Employees.
Ted: What does that mean?  +++$+++  Barney: It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.
Marshall: GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.  +++$+++  Barney: It's serious there.
Bilson: I love.  +++$+++  Barney: Really?
Lily: My God. I am so excited.  I will read.  +++$+++  Barney: Read it.
Lily: I do not understand any of these words.  +++$+++  Barney: One of them is supposed to be famous?
Lily: My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.  +++$+++  Barney: You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?
Ted: I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your "working group", I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.  +++$+++  Barney: They've turned, eh?
Lily: It's exciting.  +++$+++  Barney: With this economy?
Ted: Ultimately, I am grateful.  +++$+++  Barney: What was it with Bilson?
Ted: After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.  +++$+++  Barney: You've hit with a chair?
Ted: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: Well done.
Ted: People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, almost.
Barney: Yeah, almost.  +++$+++  Barney: Go! You want that!
Girl: My shoulder!  +++$+++  Barney: Come on.
Pattern: Stinson, in my office! Now!  +++$+++  Barney: sh1t.
Pattern: Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!  +++$+++  Barney: I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!
McCracken: Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.  +++$+++  Barney: You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.
Barney: You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.  +++$+++  Barney: My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.
McCracken: I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck shooting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!  +++$+++  Barney: You regret it.
Marshall: I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?  +++$+++  Barney: What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.
Ted: Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle.
Ted: Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.  +++$+++  Barney: No list of Murtaugh.
Marshall: Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little sh1ts, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! Suicide, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.  +++$+++  Barney: There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.
Ted: Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.  +++$+++  Barney: Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.
Ted: And if you fail?  +++$+++  Barney: I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.
Robin: An agreement of honor!  +++$+++  Barney: Come on guys, you do it!
Ted: There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?  +++$+++  Barney: "To pierce the ear. "Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother.  Do you mind if I use your futon?
Robin: There is no futon.  +++$+++  Barney: Put it there, guys.
Robin: What's the matter?  +++$+++  Barney: It's on the list. "Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. "
Ted: You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.  +++$+++  Barney: What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, "pushing a medical" on the list.  Hold on. Bar here...
Ted : The next morning, Barney woke up on the futon in the living room.  +++$+++  Barney: Done.  "Drinking shots with strangers. "Done.
Ted: OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.  +++$+++  Barney: No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth!  You should have a straw?
Marshall: Everything that's Chinese to me.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, this is Barney.
Robin: And Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: We can not answer because...
Robin: He watches football and I'm...  +++$+++  Barney: Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded...
Robin:... soon...  +++$+++  Barney:... we...
Robin and Barney:... can!  +++$+++  Barney: "Making an autoresponder message to two annoying."Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay.
Robin: Your ear begins to feel.  +++$+++  Barney: It's good.
Ted: Removes "colonoscopy" and "sleeping with an old", and is a cinch.  +++$+++  Barney: New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.
Ted: Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.  +++$+++  Barney: Bet held.
Ted: "Put on reading glasses. "Done. "Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. "With pleasure.  What happened to you?  +++$+++  Barney: I just had a little "screw up my knee and it hurts" incident.
Ted: How did you do?  +++$+++  Barney: It... "Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer."
Marshall: Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...  +++$+++  Barney: Ted Calls. I want to go.
Ted: Got up at 4am... Done.  +++$+++  Barney: It answers?
Robin: I have not called yet.  +++$+++  Barney: Hurry up, Robin.
Ted: Okay. "Take time to answer the phone. "  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was.
Robin: As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.  +++$+++  Barney: No, he remains a. "The beer funnel. "
Ted: Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.  +++$+++  Barney: No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is killing me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.
Ted:... that Murtaugh kept repeating: "I'm too old for this stuff," but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.  +++$+++  Barney: And then the hospital.
McCracken: My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.  +++$+++  Barney: Really?
Ted: Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.  +++$+++  Barney: It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.
Lily: Tell it.  +++$+++  Barney: Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?  It's funny.
Lily: Yeah, I can not hang out with you.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on. It's funny. This is...
Ted: I told you so.  +++$+++  Barney: She'll be back.
Ted: I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.  +++$+++  Barney: You know for layoffs?
Marshall: Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?  +++$+++  Barney: Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.
Marshall: I would like to have your insurance.  +++$+++  Barney: You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.
Marshall: I work harder than anyone in my division.  +++$+++  Barney: Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.
Marshall: What do you mean something?  +++$+++  Barney: You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.
Marshall: I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?  +++$+++  Barney: It's always food.
Marshall: It's always food.  +++$+++  Barney: You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.
Marshall: I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.  +++$+++  Barney: Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man.
Marshall: That's great!  +++$+++  Barney: Claw tape!
Marshall: I love Toy-man.  +++$+++  Barney: You see? You need something. Youtube-like man.
Marshall: You're right. I need something.  +++$+++  Barney: But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.
Barney: But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.  +++$+++  Barney: You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.
Robin: Okay, but PJ does not help.  +++$+++  Barney: If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere.
Ted: You see? It is useful.  +++$+++  Barney: PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?
Ted: No, I guide him.  +++$+++  Barney: A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?
Ted: Ted Mosby?  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead! PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me.
Marshall: I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?  +++$+++  Barney: Fired. What else you got?
Marshall: I have others. Ties-Fun-man.  +++$+++  Barney: Fired.
Marshall: Info-Unusual-man?  +++$+++  Barney: Did you know? Whether you're fired?
Marshall: Stretch-man?  +++$+++  Barney: upside down Vir.
Marshall: The Monty-Python-man?  +++$+++  Barney: We are the knights who say... You're fired.
Marshall: Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.  +++$+++  Barney: Not bad. You got maybe something.
Marshall: Great! Great! I Simulates-man!  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.
Man: OK, guys?  +++$+++  Barney: Hi, Frank.
PJ: Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.  +++$+++  Barney: Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.
Marshall: Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.  +++$+++  Barney: Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.
Marshall: A waste?  +++$+++  Barney: Last week!
Robin: This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.  +++$+++  Barney: I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!
Marshall: Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?  +++$+++  Barney: Because it hurts!
Marshall: How so?  +++$+++  Barney: It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.
Marshall: I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.  +++$+++  Barney: It's funny anyway, right?
Toy-man: You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.  +++$+++  Barney: You see, Sports-man. People adore you.
Marshall: Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.  +++$+++  Barney: You're kidding!
Marshall: How are you?  +++$+++  Barney: As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...
Marshall: I know you're in love with Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Marshall: Lily told me.  +++$+++  Barney: She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.
Marshall: Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.  +++$+++  Barney: Really?
Marshall: It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.
Marshall: Tell her how you feel?  +++$+++  Barney: No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.
Marshall: I can perhaps help you.  +++$+++  Barney: You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.
PJ: I'll find something.  +++$+++  Barney: Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.
Marshall: Hey, Chow-man!  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Toy-man!
Marshall: Who's this guy?  +++$+++  Barney: He is not here. I think we should leave.
Marshall: Really?  +++$+++  Barney: It's happened before.
Lily: Sorry.  Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this!  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, Lily, listen.
Robin: Barney's awesome.  +++$+++  Barney: Robin's more than just awe-"some." She's awe-"quite a bit." She's awe-"a whole darn lot."
Robin: We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh yeah.
Robin: Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, It's us. You understand, right?
Ted: A fedora!  I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!  +++$+++  Barney: That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.
Robin: OK, I should get going. I got a date.  +++$+++  Barney: You're still seeing that guy?
Robin and Barney:  What!  +++$+++  Barney: I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds.
Lily: So, how long has this been going on?  +++$+++  Barney: All summer.
Lily: I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.  +++$+++  Barney and Robin: Wow, wow...
Barney and Robin: Wow, wow...  +++$+++  Barney: Girlfriend?
Robin: Slow your roll there, Lilypad.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, yeah.
Robin: We should figure out what this is.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, we should. Or. Or...
Robin: Okay, now, we have to figure this out.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, we do. Or. Or...
Robin: We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, "I don't know.
Robin: Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.
Lily: No, no, no . You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.  +++$+++  Barney: Or. Or...
Ted: Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?
Ted: I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.
Lily: I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly.
Lily: If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.  +++$+++  Barney: Amen.
Lily: You have to make things clear.  +++$+++  Barney: Run tell that.
Lily: Define the relationship.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.
Barney: Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, can't you just let us be happy?
Lily: You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.  +++$+++  Barney: And that's not happy?
Lily: Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.  +++$+++  Barney: Why? Give me one good reason.
Lily: I'll give you 20...  +++$+++  Barney: Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.
Brad: Hey Barn!  +++$+++  Barney: Hey Brad.
Brad: Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.  +++$+++  Barney: We're not gonna have the talk.
Marshall: What?!  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you, Ted.
Ted: Because Robin is already his girlfriend.  +++$+++  Barney: What?!
Ted: MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...  +++$+++  Barney: How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.
Ted: "Gremlins"?  +++$+++  Barney: Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them
Ted: What about brunch? Is brunch cool?  +++$+++  Barney: No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.
Ted: OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?  +++$+++  Barney: Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...
Barney: Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...  +++$+++  Barney: I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?
Robin: Why not? Lay it on me.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey Brad!
Barney: Hey Brad!  +++$+++  Barney: Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!
Brad: It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.
Robin: That's putting it a bit strongly.  +++$+++  Barney: A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.
Lily: Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?  +++$+++  Barney: Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.
Ted:  Wait. Does professor have one "F" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two "F's". That looks right. I think that's right.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.
Robin: We've been over this. Unless I say "flugelhorn" you haven't gone too far.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I meant punching Brad.
Robin: God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Lily: No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.  +++$+++  Barney: We are not having the talk!
Ted: Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.  +++$+++  Barney: Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here . Okay, good luck. Byesies.
Robin:  Nice job, Ted.  +++$+++  Barney:  Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?
Robin:  Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?
Robin:  Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.  +++$+++  Barney: I know, right?
Robin: Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend
Ted : Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe we should go back to being just friends.
Robin: Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.  +++$+++  Barney: Good. Me, neither.
Robin: Friends isn't gonna work.  +++$+++  Barney: We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?
Robin: I know something we're good at.  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...
Robin: Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.  +++$+++  Barney: And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.
Robin: We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.  +++$+++  Barney: And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.
Robin: And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.  +++$+++  Barney: She can handle her Scotch.
Robin:  He's my boyfriend.  +++$+++  Barney: And she's my girlfriend.
Robin:  She bought it.  +++$+++  Barney: Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.
Robin: Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?  +++$+++  Barney: You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.
Robin: Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.  +++$+++  Barney: Flugelhorn?
Girl 3: Barack Obama Jr.?!  +++$+++  Barney: Mm-hmm. And yes... we can.
Robin: And it's not just that, it's other things.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey. What's wrong?
Robin:  It was just one thing after another at work today, and then...  I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...  +++$+++  Barney: Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.
Robin: Oh, thanks.  +++$+++  Barney: And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have s*x. Mm-kay?
Ted: Bowl?  +++$+++  Barney: She really said that?
Ted: And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--
Ted: Mm-hmm.  +++$+++  Barney: I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!
Robin: Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.  +++$+++  Barney: ...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!
Barney: ...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!  +++$+++  Barney: Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?
Ted: Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay.
Robin: Hey, guys. What you talking about?  +++$+++  Barney and Ted: Fantasy football.
Ted:  "How To Date Robin Scherbatsky." Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down...  +++$+++  Barney: I'm bored.
Ted: You said you wanted my help.  +++$+++  Barney: Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?
Ted: We did that ready.  +++$+++  Barney:  No, like, really big boobs.
Ted: No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.  +++$+++  Barney: Can we have class outside?
Ted: Barney!  +++$+++  Barney: What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- "H's" or no?
Ted: Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?  +++$+++  Barney: They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?
Ted: Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?  +++$+++  Barney: Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70% off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid.
Ted: Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean?  +++$+++  Barney: You guys just had s*x? Oh! Wasn't me.
Ted: Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...  +++$+++  Barney: Okay.
Ted: This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter.  Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?  +++$+++  Barney: That's a building.
Ted: Oh...  That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...  +++$+++  Barney: Dude!
Ted: Right. The most important facial expression of all.  +++$+++  Barney: Whoa...
Ted: Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call "touchy-feely." She doesn't say, "I love you," like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, "You're an idiot."  +++$+++  Barney: "You're an idiot"?
Ted: Oh, yeah...lefty like that.  +++$+++  Barney: I can't believe I'm taking sexual advice from Ted Mosby. That's like taking fashion advice from... well, Ted Mosby.
Ted: Three: "Never, ever play the 'Guess Who' game with her."  +++$+++  Barney: What do you mean?
Ted: Barney! Do you have a problem with this class?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.
Ted: Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor?  Or should I turn it up for you? .
Ted: Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz.  +++$+++  Barney: What...
Ted: When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?  +++$+++  Barney: Trick question. Get her butterscotch.
Ted: Correct! Why?  +++$+++  Barney: Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.
Ted: Correct! What is Robin's dream job?  +++$+++  Barney: To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.
Ted: Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?  +++$+++  Barney: No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: "Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?"
Ted: Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.  +++$+++  Barney: "Oh, Captain! My Captain!"
Ted: How good was Dead Poet's Society?  +++$+++  Barney: I know, right? The end? Tears.
Ted:  Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh.  +++$+++  Barney: I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?
Robin: What the hell do you two think you're doing?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, did you sells out?
Ted: Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.  +++$+++  Barney: On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.
Robin: You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?  +++$+++  Barney: Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!
Robin:  And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.  +++$+++  Barney: That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.
Ted: I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.  But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small
Robin: You know...  +++$+++  Barney: Hmm?
Robin: That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.  +++$+++  Barney: And your work address.
Barney: And your work address.  +++$+++  Barney: Whoa.
Ted : It was the Fall of 2009 and I was a professor now. So I decided to change my look a little bit. And people were noticing.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.
Marshall: You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.  +++$+++  Barney: Because the people who wear them are constantly going, "Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?"
Marshall: Best night ever!  +++$+++  Barney:  Worst night ever.
Ted: Really? How?  +++$+++  Barney: It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
Marshall: In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!  +++$+++  Barney: And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.
Marshall: Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.  +++$+++  Barney: Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.
Robin: P.S., not sitting great.  +++$+++  Barney: And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.
Robin: Show him.  +++$+++  Barney: This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night.  It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.
Marshall : Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day.  +++$+++  Barney: Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.
Ted: I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?  +++$+++  Barney: I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.
Robin: Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.  +++$+++  Barney: Let's do it again, soon.
Ted: Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, no, it doesn't.
Ted: Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?
Ted: Westchester. Why?  +++$+++  Barney:  You're the sexless innkeeper.
Ted: What the hell is "the sexless innkeeper"?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?
Ted: Not really.  +++$+++  Barney: T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens.  The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...
Ted: Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, "where do you live?"And she said, "one block south.". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you
Ted: Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket
Ted: No way.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.
Marshall: And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.  +++$+++  Barney: Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.
Robin: Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.  +++$+++  Barney: Plus, the alien thing.
Marshall: You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.  +++$+++  Barney: I think they bought it.
Ted: Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?
Ted: Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.  +++$+++  Barney: To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?
Ted: For god's sake!  +++$+++  Barney: Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.
Marshall: Hey! Hey, guys.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.
Robin: Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
Lily: Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.  +++$+++  Barney: Who the hell are these people?
Robin: Pfft, who needs 'em?  +++$+++  Barney: Pfft. Not us.
Barney: Pfft. Not us.  +++$+++  Barney and Robin are walking sadly in the street. We can hear a song:
Woman: Just the two of you?  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.
Ted: Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?  +++$+++  Barney: Maybe. But they're Armani.
Marshall: You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.  +++$+++  Barney: Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?
Lily: Come here, you two.  +++$+++  Barney: We'll never sleep on thegouda again.
Ted: Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?  +++$+++  Barney: No, not really.
Ted: 'twas the night before, I had hours to kill.  I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.  +++$+++  Barney: With quill?
Ted: Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said "classy," but her eyes whispered "sin." She said, "you're a teacher?" I said, "yes, indeed." "I must have you," she moaned."I'm turned on by tweed." With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.  +++$+++  Barney: No way. You made that up.
Girl: Are you coming back bed, professor?  +++$+++  Barney: Whew!
Ted : Children, if there is a major theme in this story, and I swear, it's almost, really, not quite at the end of the story.This is timing. The timing makes all the difference. For example, I never met your mother if it was not for a wedding.The last of the weddings that I thought would be.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you think of this tie?
Ted: Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?  +++$+++  Barney: This one is better?
Ted: The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?
Ted: Yeah, sure.  +++$+++  Barney: I do not really talk about the tie.
Ted: Yeah, I realized that Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?
Ted: Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.  +++$+++  Barney: That of Punchy.
Ted: Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, no problem, of course.
Ted: Ok  +++$+++  Barney: Woow.
Ted: Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland.
Ted : This fall I became the youngest designer in the history of New York by building a skyscraper. This earned me a brilliant article in a magazine. I plan to frame it. Uncle Barney had different plans.  +++$+++  Barney: Here's your speech. "In single file, girls. No big. "
Ted: This is ridiculous.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. "In single file, girls. "
Ted : Children, you remember Nora. But the other day...  +++$+++  Barney: I'll call you.
Robin: Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?  +++$+++  Barney: I did not call.
Lily: Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings.
Ted : So we all went to my hometown where we had planned to celebrate the marriage of Punchy. Uncle Barney had other plans.  +++$+++  Barney: Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.
Robin: You're going to try to make you anybody here?  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Robin: My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.  +++$+++  Barney: It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%...
Ted: 17. He always reverse.  +++$+++  Barney:... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?
All: No, no.  +++$+++  Barney: We'll never know unless I try tonight.
Marshall: During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.  +++$+++  Barney: Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero.
Robin: You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you?  Sea...
Punchy: Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.  +++$+++  Barney: Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that.
Robin: Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?  +++$+++  Barney: It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?
Robin: Well. Barney, just to make things clear...  +++$+++  Barney: I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.
Robin: Barney... I...  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.
Robin: Wait, you said you'd never recalled.  +++$+++  Barney: I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.
Robin: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling...
Robin: To tell you how I feel.  +++$+++  Barney: To tell you how I feel.
Robin: I know it did not work the first time...  +++$+++  Barney: I know it did not work the first time...
Robin:... and it makes no sense...  +++$+++  Barney:... and it makes no sense...
Robin:... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.  +++$+++  Barney:... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.
Robin: Is there a part of you that wants to try again?  +++$+++  Barney: Is there a part of you that wants to try again?
Ted: No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?  +++$+++  Barney: I chose the right tie, huh?
Ted : This is a good story. I will return. We are not even close to the end.  +++$+++  Barney: You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?
Ted: Oh, I'll cry too.  +++$+++  Barney: Between.
Ted : I decided to go to the bar to be quiet. It was not really that.  +++$+++  Barney: I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.
Ted: Not at all.  +++$+++  Barney: Look what I saw yesterday.
Marshall: No problem.  +++$+++  Barney: I gotta go.
Barney: I gotta go.  +++$+++  Barney: She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.
Ted: There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.  +++$+++  Barney: They have a big problem.
Ted: I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... "little known" because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.  +++$+++  Barney: If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.
Ted: And a half?  +++$+++  Barney: An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.
Marshall: What's new?  +++$+++  Barney: Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.
Marshall: Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?  +++$+++  Barney: I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.
Marshall: Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a killer foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.  +++$+++  Barney: Let me ask you a question.
Marshall: Go ahead.  +++$+++  Barney: Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?
Marshall: Not really.  +++$+++  Barney: So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.
Marshall: But if I said that, we will play, so...  +++$+++  Barney: You argue. Robin, we do not fight.
Ted: Of course I do.  +++$+++  Barney: No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...
Ted: So when you think you will play and you get up you go?  +++$+++  Barney: It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.
Marshall: I can not believe Robin supports it.  +++$+++  Barney: Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.
Marshall: But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.  +++$+++  Barney: There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.
Marshall: Go to the basics!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay.
Barney: Okay.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you, doll.
Lily: Honey, you're going to wash it?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, "Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel" is what you will paint the?
Lily: No. Of course not.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.
Lily: Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.  +++$+++  Barney: It's because you're a woman.
Lily: I do not even know why we laugh!  +++$+++  Barney: Of course not.
Marshall: Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.  +++$+++  Barney: Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.
Barney: Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy artillery.  +++$+++  Barney: Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.
Lily: You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.  +++$+++  Barney: Now, turn around.
Ted: No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.  +++$+++  Barney: The piercing was cool.
Marshall: I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!  +++$+++  Barney: You're welcome.
Robin: I think that's true.  +++$+++  Barney: I told you.
Robin: Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney: Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!
Ted: How was the trip?  +++$+++  Barney: Okay.
Ted: What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?  +++$+++  Barney: It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?
Ted: We all came out a year.  +++$+++  Barney: short, and your weekend?
Marshall: I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?  +++$+++  Barney: What happened to the "I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love"?
Marshall: Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.  +++$+++  Barney: You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.
Marshall: This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...  +++$+++  Barney: What do you eat?
Robin: Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Ro-Ro.
Robin: Nothing. We're just happy.  +++$+++  Barney: As Gandhi said, "A smile costs nothing, baby."
Ted : And suddenly, I found how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: How will Marshall and Lily?
Robin: Those two worry me, really.  +++$+++  Barney: You and your big, huge heart.
Ted: Enough. The game is over.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you mean by that?
Ted: Phil told me.  +++$+++  Barney: Who the hell is Phil?
Ted: And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?  +++$+++  Barney: All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.
Barney: All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.  +++$+++  Barney: I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.
Robin: It's your board that is zero.  +++$+++  Barney: You're on the side of Lily? You...  No. We will argue and I can not spin.
Robin: I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.  +++$+++  Barney: Or so I tried the jump?
Robin: Or just the pants?  +++$+++  Barney: This trick of dodging is over?
Robin: I think.  +++$+++  Barney: You have the? This is the smallest!
Robin: They fight because of you!?  +++$+++  Barney: And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.
Robin: All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.  +++$+++  Barney: The tie murdered by Robin.
Robin: The hidden camera in the headboard.  +++$+++  Barney: As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.
Ted: I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!  +++$+++  Barney: Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.
Lily: No, but what is your favorite.  +++$+++  Barney: We need advice.
Lily: And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.  +++$+++  Barney: More important than winning.
Robin: Good night.  +++$+++  Barney: What about now?
Robin: I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.  +++$+++  Barney: Or, there is a bench in the elevator.
Robin: That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?  +++$+++  Barney: Grave. It's not a competition.
Ted : Children, since I know your Uncle Barney, he has always had strong views on relationships.  +++$+++  Barney: Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted.
Ted : And yet, in fall 2009, it was he who had a girlfriend.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on. Open it. It's p0rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.
Ted: It's your p0rn collection.  +++$+++  Barney: This is my collection of p0rn! I offer you my p0rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more.
Marshall: This is obvious.  +++$+++  Barney: What does that mean?
Marshall: Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.  +++$+++  Barney: What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.
Lily: He really is growing at a time.  +++$+++  Barney: We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.
Voice: ArchiSexture.  +++$+++  Barney: If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p0rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!

If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!  +++$+++  Barney: I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy.  Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p0rn...  Do not worry. The green light means it is off.
Robin: I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.  +++$+++  Barney: It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.
Ted: I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry, I have my own way tonight.
Lily: How do you go?  +++$+++  Barney: Super. Relations are deadly...
Robin: Shut up...  +++$+++  Barney: Exchanges and compromise...
Robin: Shut up...  +++$+++  Barney: Monogamy is the best.
Robin: Shut up.  +++$+++  Barney: Tagline!
Ted : But it got worse... more  +++$+++  Barney: More hungry...
Ted : The more they said everything was fine. In truth, Barney and Robin had just let go. But after a few weeks for us, they looked like that.  +++$+++  Barney: I can... in a minute.
Ted : I left them alone. But this weekend there...  +++$+++  Barney: Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?
Marshall: I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?  +++$+++  Barney: Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!
Marshall: So you're happy?  +++$+++  Barney: Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, "Every moment is a battle."
Marshall: So you're happy?  +++$+++  Barney: And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.
Barney: And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.  +++$+++  Barney: Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.
Robin: Okay. Decides that the piece.  +++$+++  Barney: What was the pizza again?
Robin: Face.  +++$+++  Barney: It's face.
Barney: It's face.  +++$+++  Barney: s*x... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?
Robin: Please, shut up.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Robin: I thought you had mentioned, sorry.  This is an engagement ring?Are you...?  +++$+++  Barney: No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?
Robin: We're committed to one another.  +++$+++  Barney: Your business is already in my apartment.
Robin: Easier for taxes.  +++$+++  Barney: And for your naturalization.
Robin: "Scherbatsky" is hard to spell.  +++$+++  Barney: My mother would be so happy.
Robin: Yeah, I guess.  +++$+++  Barney: No reason not to do so.
Barney: No reason not to do so.  +++$+++  Barney: We get married!
Robin: You do not know any that girl over there?  +++$+++  Barney: No, I do not think.  No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?
Robin: You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?  +++$+++  Barney: It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper.
Robin: He wears a diaper.  +++$+++  Barney: No, it's protective armor.
Robin: A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on.
Robin: It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.  +++$+++  Barney: You know, I'm sick.
Robin: I said nothing.  +++$+++  Barney: The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper...
Lily: And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American War.  +++$+++  Barney: thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?
Robin: You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.  +++$+++  Barney: She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?
Robin: Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.  +++$+++  Barney: I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord...
Ted : You see, rather in the evening, when Lily was believed that Barney and Robin had spotted us, this is what they really saw.  +++$+++  Barney, seeing himself in the window of the restaurant: Why this big and this old will not stop us... It's us!
Robin: Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not.
Robin: What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar.  +++$+++  Barney: We love scotch. It is awesome.
Robin: That might be it. There may be too great there.  +++$+++  Barney: Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled.
Robin: Me too. We separate?  +++$+++  Barney: I think. sh1t. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again.
Robin: It's a stormtrooper?  +++$+++  Barney: It's not a stormtr... We're going from here?
Alan: How do you know?  +++$+++  Barney: Friends that are found. I like it.
Robin: One for the Road?  +++$+++  Barney: And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone...
Robin: I am already involved with Ted.  +++$+++  Barney: It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone...
Robin: Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill?  +++$+++  Barney: Dad returned.
Alan: Clip? The video for "Sandcastles"! It was also this together.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you mean "too"?
Ted : While others are dedicated solely to...  +++$+++  Barney: All women of New York. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mother, lock your daughters. Daughters, lock your MAQACENJaR.
Ted: Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot.  +++$+++  Barney: You have the right answer!
Lily: You're not rush a little, then?  +++$+++  Barney: Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles.
Barney: Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles.  +++$+++  Barney: The Roles book contains all the scams, trickery, deception, underhand, cunning, nonsense, and embobinages tricks I used, or expected use, to nab the girls and do their business.
Marshall: You're writing another book? Stephen King was one right there.  +++$+++  Barney: It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca...
Barney: It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca...  +++$+++  Barney: Do not drink it. I saw a guy put something.
Woman: What? Who?  +++$+++  Barney: This guy.
Woman: Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney:... Until more advanced maneuvers, such as the Ms. Stinsfire.
Ted: What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?  +++$+++  Barney: Glad you asked. The Lorenzon Von Matterhorn will be my comeback on stage. Or, you know, in my bed. In fact, my bed is on a stage. I put it on a platform and installed lighting. A real production. Barney goes!
Lily: I had put aside for Ted Shelly for 3 years.  +++$+++  Barney: My hen, Ted did not miss much. She is brainy, boring, a bit boring in bed. In fact it would have been perfect for Ted.Oops!  If I had known she was there for Ted, I would have obviously not done, but... given the circumstances, I think Ted would be proud of me. I managed The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Lily: What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?  +++$+++  Barney: Glad you asked.
Barney: Glad you asked.  +++$+++  Barney: To achieve the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn is what you need, basic knowledge in web design and a truly unique fake name. So think about your fake name right away. You? Fine.Now choose your target.  Preferably a girl with a great big... phone.  Yeah that's me.
Shelly: I know you?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.
Shelly: You are, kind known?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes. You do not know who I am, does not it? It feels good for once. Nice to meet you...
Shelly: Shelly.  +++$+++  Barney: Shelly? Again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. It is written as it is pronounced, with two "T".  Then, once you leave, she takes out her phone and tries Lorenzo Von Matterhorn on the Internet. And that's when she discovers... A series of fake websites, all devoted to the incredible life of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. A false item of business on Lorenzo, the hermit billionaire. The fake of the Explorer Club newsletter on his trip to the North Pole in an airship, a feat of imagination and challenge. The fake medical journal with a story to make you cry the doctors saying that a reduction of the pen1s is not an option. And time to return...  I hate to be cheeky, but I can offer you a coffee?
Shelly: Yes! Please.  +++$+++  Barney: How much is a coffee today, $ 50? And here we go.
Lily: It's horrible. You realize you've broken her heart? She is inconsolable.  +++$+++  Barney: Why would it be inconsolable? The airship of Lorenzo will not disappear in the Arctic for a week. Sorry if this is that someone told her that it was lies.
Lily: Lies!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh my God! Well, I hope you are pleased with you.
Lily: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Thou hast broken my heart.
Lily: Me?  +++$+++  Barney: You! She will never trust a man. You've spoiled for Ted.Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, the twin brother of Lorenzo.
Woman: You're an astronaut?  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, I'm in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA... Sn&aring;sa.
Woman: Sn&aring;sa? You went to the moon and everything?  +++$+++  Barney: No Moon you know, but I went on Slune.
Lily: Well, Barney, you go out... You just get out of a sincere relationship. You're a big boy now. You can return to your towers to two euros.  +++$+++  Barney: Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros.
Barney: Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros.  +++$+++  Barney: I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I excuterais he will not come.Glad you asked.
Barney: I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I excuterais he will not come.Glad you asked.  +++$+++  Barney: The To run it will not come, you will need the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Got it? Fine. For generations, this is the place chosen by New Yorkers for reunion with their lost lovers of view, you need to go to every girl and say, "He will not come."
Woman: What are you talking about?  +++$+++  Barney: Let it go.  He will not come. He will not come. She's not coming? Sorry.  Until... He will not come.
Marshall: Millions. But when I go in search of a mirror or the remote because Lily and I had an argument and she has hidden there, whereupon I fall? Frozen waffles. It's like that. You go out to get the newspaper, but you come back with frozen waffles.And there, frozen waffles he's a guy. As long as you're there, you take it back frozen waffles? And there, frozen waffles are... frozen waffles.  +++$+++  Barney, entering: Everyone, code red! Emergency. Lock.Nobody gets out.
Robin: What happened?  +++$+++  Barney: I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl.
Robin: I'm leaving.  +++$+++  Barney: So, we came up to me, and I go to my room to prepare the camera... lighting candles... and when I go out, nobody, paper and more roles! We all know who is responsible for that.
Lily: Yes, we know.  +++$+++  Barney: Al-Qaeda.
Lily: No, you idiot. That was me.  +++$+++  Barney: You... enfoire dirty!
Lily: An actress friend.  +++$+++  Barney: An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag.
Lily: I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see.  +++$+++  Barney: You would not dare.
Lily: No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages.  +++$+++  Barney: You did not say nonsense.
Lily: No more nonsense!  +++$+++  Barney: Slim.
Ted: No.  +++$+++  Barney: I was abandoned at the altar.
Woman: Really? A genie comes out?  +++$+++  Barney: Only if you rub hard enough.
Ted: Apparently, it will rain.  +++$+++  Barney: If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all.
Marshall: Sure baby, but there is something odd. I flipped through the whole book. There is no role called The Diver.  +++$+++  Barney: Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible reprizze.
Lily: Barney, no. You are...  +++$+++  Barney: Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book.
Robin: I did not worship the book.  +++$+++  Barney: But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular.
Robin: We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.  +++$+++  Barney: I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed.
Lily: So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing.  +++$+++  Barney: Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins bomb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind.
Lily: I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles.  +++$+++  Barney: Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee?
Lily: Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks...  +++$+++  Barney: A Pringles, but still.
Ted: It's The Diver.  +++$+++  Barney: Step one, talk to a friend Book Roles. Step two, play with one of his colleagues and make angry she steals the Book.Step three, put the combi and say you will do a final round, The Diver with the sexy girl next to the bar. Your friend, let's call her Lily, told him everything about the book. Now the hard part.When Lily and daughter are questioning The Diver, remove the mask, and pull out the stops on your deepest insecurities that do not exist because you are awesome. Sad for you, Lily talks about you to the girl who agrees to have coffee. And... is... gone.
Lily: Wait, wait. I will find. Left.  +++$+++  Barney: Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers.
Ted: Great!  +++$+++  Barney: You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?
Ted: But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.  +++$+++  Barney: That's exactly it, according to the website!
Lily: Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!
Robin: You too. I gotta go. It is called?  Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.  +++$+++  Barney: She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group.
Lily: Tradition? It was never done.  +++$+++  Barney: It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted...
Ted: Goes?  +++$+++  Barney: I was going to say "was found eaten by her cats," but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!
Ted: I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. "Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge."Or, in Italian original...  +++$+++  Barney: You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats!
Ted: Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.  +++$+++  Barney: Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts.
Ted: It's about an open bar.  +++$+++  Barney: We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller.
Lily: I just got a text from Robin. It says...  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent.
Lily: What do we do?  +++$+++  Barney: I do we go to the party, that's what!  We met at the meeting of ornithophilic.
Marissa: I do not believe.  +++$+++  Barney: Lovers of wicker?
Marissa: So, this way. We are together.  +++$+++  Barney: I said I'd get us.
Marshall: I'm not dressed for it.  +++$+++  Barney: In a coined word "asshole-Apocalypse."
Marshall: He will watch it.  +++$+++  Barney: This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better.
Marshall, laughing: Films... right? Actors. Willem Dafoe. Fun Fact of Willem Dafoe, his name sounds a bit like a frog, a parrot that talks. Willem Dafoe...! Willem Dafoe...!  +++$+++  Barney: As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package.
Woman: I do not think, my dear. You're too old for me.  +++$+++  Barney: Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday.
Ted: Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.  +++$+++  Barney: But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?
Ted: Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.  +++$+++  Barney: It's an evening.
Lily: It means nothing.  +++$+++  Barney: It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship.
Ted: See you tomorrow.  +++$+++  Barney: All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something.
Marshall: The best tradition of all time!  +++$+++  Barney: You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well.
Lily: Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant!
Lily: No.  +++$+++  Barney: My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh?
Robot: That's all you got, fagot?  +++$+++  Barney: You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year?
Lily: I can not.  +++$+++  Barney: You can not?
Man: Okay, again! Bravo, my boy!  +++$+++  Barney: No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world.
Marshall: The world is pretty cool right now.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is 18... Gong!
Marshall: Babies.  +++$+++  Barney: I hope Ted is unhappy.
Ted: Thank you, Will Shortz.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want.
Ted: I gotta run.  +++$+++  Barney: Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily.
Marshall: Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?  +++$+++  Barney: It is not I who make the rules.
Marshall: Deal.  +++$+++  Barney: Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of asshole that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.
Lily:... never...  +++$+++  Barney:... seen.
Clint, singing: And Mahatma Gandhi. And pancakes. Well all together! And the dragon. And you.  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.
Barney: Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.  +++$+++  Barney: You're currently whining?
Robin: I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?  +++$+++  Barney: Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.
Barney: Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.  +++$+++  Barney: And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!
Older woman: You marry when?  +++$+++  Barney: Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!
Marshall: Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!  +++$+++  Barney: Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.
Robin: I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional.  Shh. Leave it alone.
Robin: Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.  +++$+++  Barney: She cried to the song of Clint.
Ted: I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.  +++$+++  Barney: And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?
Ted: I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.  +++$+++  Barney: Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?
Robin: Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.  +++$+++  Barney: The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.
Robin: My God, you had to be completely stuffed.  +++$+++  Barney: No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.
Robin: Children? Why...  +++$+++  Barney: Put rockets in...
Robin: Bourre.  +++$+++  Barney: Gamin.
Marshall: Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!  +++$+++  Barney: You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.
Robin: Are you crying?  +++$+++  Barney: I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?
Robin: Not as much as me.  +++$+++  Barney: I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.
Robin: $ 500? No worries.  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.
Barney: Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, you're...
Man: Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?
Ted: But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.  +++$+++  Barney: It was Robin! "What! "Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.
Robin: Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course.
Marshall: You're always a little too far.  +++$+++  Barney: sh1t.
Ted: Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.  +++$+++  Barney: I see a complaint.
Ted: You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you. My God.
Ted: Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.  +++$+++  Barney: OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.
Ted: What do you mean?  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.
Ted: Please, stop.  +++$+++  Barney: Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.
Ted: What are you talking about?  +++$+++  Barney: I wanted to be your father!
Ted: What does that mean?  +++$+++  Barney: Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.
Barney: Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that b*st*rd stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.  +++$+++  Barney: And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.
Virginia: Here we go.  +++$+++  Barney: It is a good time. Not much traffic...
Virginia: Oh, I love this song.  +++$+++  Barney: Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...
Marshall: Again?! One too many!  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.
Robin: Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, this is a Mellencamp.
Ted: It's silly.  +++$+++  Barney: Your mother and I were at second base.
Ted : No one played as well as Barney with this limit. A breeze for him.  +++$+++  Barney: I love traveling.
Woman: Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?  +++$+++  Barney: Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.
Ted: You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, a blonde, it's easy.
Barney: Ted, a blonde, it's easy.  +++$+++  Barney: Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.
Marshall: But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.  +++$+++  Barney: So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space.
Ted: Why are you lying all the time?  +++$+++  Barney: I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!
Delivery Man: Our coupons are your effigy.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, "stop eating pizza. "Marshall:" Why? "Doc:" To you examine. " But seriously, we laugh because we love you.
Lily: Did you get mugged?  +++$+++  Barney: Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said "Hands up! "?
Marshall: It was downright terrifying.  +++$+++  Barney: It was downright terrifying.
Marshall: What are you doing?  +++$+++  Barney: I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.
Marshall: Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a gun. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.  +++$+++  Barney: I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.
Marshall: Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?  +++$+++  Barney: It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. "
Marshall: I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.  +++$+++  Barney: So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!
Lily: He assaulted you naked?  +++$+++  Barney: I do not ask where he kept his weapon.
Marshall: It's good. It's good.  +++$+++  Barney: You're telling us...
Marshall: For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.  +++$+++  Barney: You've been mugged by a monkey?
Lily: This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.  +++$+++  Barney: Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?
Robin, who happens: Hi, friends. What's new?  +++$+++  Barney: New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.
Marshall: Okay. That's what happened.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...
Marshall: I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.  +++$+++  Barney: You're right. The banana was on the floor.
Marshall: Was not... Was not banana banana.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.
Lily: You've been mugged by a monkey.  +++$+++  Barney: I've just been mugged.
Ted: What?  +++$+++  Barney: That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...
Barney: That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...  +++$+++  Barney: It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.
Woman 2: Neil? Neil!  +++$+++  Barney: Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...
Woman: You've just mugged?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?
Woman: Me too.  +++$+++  Barney: And it was the best thing in my life 3.
Marshall: You're the lemon in your hair.  +++$+++  Barney: The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...
Marshall: Not at all.  +++$+++  Barney: So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?
Marshall: Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a gun.  +++$+++  Barney: You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?
Marshall: I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a weapon. In truth, it never happened.  +++$+++  Barney: I can not believe.
Marshall: What?  +++$+++  Barney: You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.
Marshall: I would not?  +++$+++  Barney: If serious, this is too funny.
Marshall: Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.  +++$+++  Barney: I, yes, but still.
Marshall: But I can not lie on national TV.  +++$+++  Barney: You know a long time. He told the truth?
Ted: I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.  +++$+++  Barney: I still say that it happened.
Ted: Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.  +++$+++  Barney: Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.
Ted: It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.  +++$+++  Barney: False! They like to discover that they lied. "Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth." Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!
Marshall: You mean what you done to him.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.
Barney: No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.  +++$+++  Barney: Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.
Lisa: Yes, Neil?  +++$+++  Barney: It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.
Lisa: Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.  +++$+++  Barney: 31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!
Lily, what happens: This is the belt of Planar 3?  +++$+++  Barney: You know it.
Marshall: You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah! I knew it.
Ted: Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?
Robin: It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, what do you do?
Ted: I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.  +++$+++  Barney: Now I want a weapon.
Marshall: No! I have not been mugged!  +++$+++  Barney: You know if it was attacked?
Ted: Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.  +++$+++  Barney: It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.
Ted: Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.
Ted: It's really happening?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course, Ted.
Ted: Sorry, can not stay.  +++$+++  Barney: It's unfortunate!
Ted: I arrive.  +++$+++  Barney: I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see.
Marshall: That is clear.  +++$+++  Barney: I've never seen.
Marshall: Sure!  +++$+++  Barney: I've never seen.
Marshall: Weather.  +++$+++  Barney: I've never seen.
Marshall: Sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: I just said.
Marshall: I knew you were listening!  +++$+++  Barney: We should not celebrate. Ted has just been dumped.Tell us everything, everything that happened. Seriously, do not forget any details. She said what? You, you said what? How you going? If you had to redo it from start, perhaps you...?
Ted: That's it. She's gone.  +++$+++  Barney: What a story. What courage to share it with us.
Lily: Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it?
Marshall: It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie.  +++$+++  Barney: First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time.
Marshall: Why have the class at any time?  +++$+++  Barney: Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently.
Lily: This is not "a" skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.  +++$+++  Barney: But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it.
Marshall: Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, "Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? "It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, "Held danger of Ninja," if you want. You stay still a transvestite.
Marshall: I do not care. It's comfortable.  +++$+++  Barney: Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work.
Ted: Why was it on your dresser?  +++$+++  Barney: It is pretty!
Marshall, old: Bridge! I won!  +++$+++  Barney: You know not to play bridge, eh?
Marshall: You're better off without her.  +++$+++  Barney: If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be.
Marshall: You know what? Go ahead, laugh.  +++$+++  Barney: Why are you wearing this stuff?
Marshall: Several reasons.  +++$+++  Barney: You can not even give five.
Marshall: Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?  +++$+++  Barney: I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.
Lily: Just as I did!  +++$+++  Barney by nightdress: Your grandfather was a wise Olaf.
Ted: I can not believe it. I need another drink.  +++$+++  Barney: I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.
Marshall: You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.  +++$+++  Barney: The Little Barney says "Mahalo."
Robin, entering: Too glad you watched that one!  +++$+++  Barney: My God, what has happened?
Robin: You have not seen the show?  +++$+++  Barney: The show! Sorry. It happened something?
Marshall: A shirt.  +++$+++  Barney: It's called a shirt.
Ted: I want to hear!  +++$+++  Barney: Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?
Robin: Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?  +++$+++  Barney: You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?
Marshall: Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell me about marriage.
Marshall: Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.  +++$+++  Barney: The coffee too?
Marshall: The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.  +++$+++  Barney: I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?
Marshall: It says you're great and everything will be fine.  +++$+++  Barney: It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?
Lily: I want the perfect group shot. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Why?
Lily: Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.  +++$+++  Barney: How dare you?
Robin: It's so rude.  +++$+++  Barney: It's true.
Lily: I would say Amanda.  +++$+++  Barney: No, it was me. And I meant it.
Marshall: Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.  +++$+++  Barney: I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!
Lily: Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, "Folks, this may be good." And this is not the only "maybe good". Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and "It's good" Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... "It proves that you selected the eyes closed" Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance.  +++$+++  Barney: You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?
Barney: You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?  +++$+++  Barney: Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from Guns N'Roses!
Lily: Group Photo!  +++$+++  Barney: And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?
Robin: It was there, we know the end.  +++$+++  Barney: False!
Lily: Oh? So do I.  +++$+++  Barney: And me too. He has how many hands?
Robin: Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.
Robin: It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.  +++$+++  Barney: Nope, not at all.
Robin: And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.  +++$+++  Barney: Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.
Marshall: They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.  +++$+++  Barney: You really put a knot!
Robin: A crisp, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: Of course.
Robin: I! A photo ugly.  +++$+++  Barney: You sure?
Robin: No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?  +++$+++  Barney: It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.
Robin: It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected? Mouse, m*therf*cker! I!  +++$+++  Barney: You sure?
Robin: Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!  +++$+++  Barney: The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.
Ted: Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.  +++$+++  Barney: They would be if Marshall was not on it.
Robin: I think Lori's age made him very wise.  +++$+++  Barney: It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.
Robin: It's a hole in your jacket?  +++$+++  Barney: What? Where?
Lily: Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.  +++$+++  Barney: Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...
Police: Okay, big guy, tell me all along.  +++$+++  Barney: It all started a week ago.
Barney: It all started a week ago.  +++$+++  Barney: I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.
Woman: Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.  +++$+++  Barney: Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.
Woman: But this is merely a tie.  +++$+++  Barney: It was not my best tie.
Police: Right.  +++$+++  Barney: So, right after that, I took her home.
Woman: When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.  +++$+++  Barney: Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.
Woman: Good night.  +++$+++  Barney: What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.
Marshall: Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.  +++$+++  Barney: I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.
Woman: I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really s*x, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.  +++$+++  Barney: Continuous. Continues.
Woman: It's the cashmere?  +++$+++  Barney: Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.
Female: 12 microns. I like the tight fibers.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.
Barney: Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.  +++$+++  Barney: She did it too!
Ted: And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, "I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? "  +++$+++  Barney: You try this sh1t of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.
Woman: It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.  +++$+++  Barney: Did you just say you got a kid!
Woman: You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.  +++$+++  Barney: Completely.
Woman: Or the second. Or the third.  +++$+++  Barney: Of course. Well...
Woman: Or the fourth.  +++$+++  Barney: Just tell me how!
Female: 17.  +++$+++  Barney: Excuse me, someone is using this stool?
Lily: If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.  +++$+++  Barney: I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...
Ted: From Robin is Robin.  +++$+++  Barney: I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.
Marshall: You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.  +++$+++  Barney: I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.
Robin: I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.  +++$+++  Barney: This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and...
Robin: It does.  +++$+++  Barney: Spoilers. Regardless, we did.
Lily: I know, but the song is rather catchy.  +++$+++  Barney: sh1t. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?
Ted: There is another option... but you're not ready.  +++$+++  Barney: Tell me.
Ted: If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.  +++$+++  Barney: A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?
Ted: If you want my help, it's a super hot date.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay.
Ted: Let me do it. I will plan everything.  +++$+++  Barney: You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?
Ted: Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...  +++$+++  Barney: What are you doing?
Ted singing: You just gotta make him understand...  +++$+++  Barney: They look at us.
Ted: How important it is for you...  +++$+++  Barney: Really? You really gonna do that?
Ted, still singing: In your super hot date, Global problems will simply be put aside, for wonders and surprises that will be the stars. Hurry, do not be late because together, you will find a country where paradise is rebukes. And then, boom! Fireworks in the sky over Manhattan! You kiss him. And your super hot date.  +++$+++  Barney: It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?
Robin: I'm fine, I'm fine.  +++$+++  Barney: Why did you do that?
Marshall: Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.  +++$+++  Barney: Why are you angry against me?
Ted: You were a real asshole to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.  +++$+++  Barney: The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.
Lily: Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.  +++$+++  Barney: What, she is upset?
Ted : Then Aunt Lily told Barney all the little details of what he had not seen since the break.  +++$+++  Barney: You should have seen.
Robin: I'm going.  +++$+++  Barney: We go back home...
Barney: We go back home...  +++$+++  Barney: I can not believe that Robin is upset.
Marshall: And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.  +++$+++  Barney: I did worse after the premiere of "The Phantom Menace."It's been like that since we broke up?
Lily: Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.  +++$+++  Barney: I know where.
Robin: Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.  +++$+++  Barney: I know you're upset.
Robin: What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.  +++$+++  Barney: You sure you're not upset?
Robin: Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?  +++$+++  Barney: You're not another number for me.
Robin: And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.  +++$+++  Barney: I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?
Robin: Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.  +++$+++  Barney: Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.
Robin: Do not sleep with Anita.  +++$+++  Barney: I promise.
Robin: Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?  +++$+++  Barney: It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.
Ted : Your uncle Barney gave Robin finally the super hot date she deserved. With a guy she deserved. Of course, there was a detail to be resolved.  +++$+++  Barney: I wanted to call you.
Anita: I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.
Anita: I see. You try the trick of "no." You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Anita: The 11th?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Anita: The fifth?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Anita: Tonight?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Anita: This evening before dinner?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Anita: Go.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry. The answer is no.
Anita: Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.  +++$+++  Barney: Here is my story.
Police: This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.  +++$+++  Barney: I hope so too.
Ted from 2030: My friends, as usual, were completely supportive.  +++$+++  Barney:  You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.
Robin:  Oh. Translation: booty-call.  +++$+++  Barney:  Total booty-call.
Ted from 2030: Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. And it became a tradition.  +++$+++  Barney:  Wow, you sound really lonely.
Lily: I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...  +++$+++  Barney:  Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.
Robin:  That's not a thing.  +++$+++  Barney:  It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.
Ted: That's actually true.  +++$+++  Barney:  Wait, there's more.
Ted: This won't be.  +++$+++  Barney:  And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.
Saint Desperatius: And I thought Pompeii was smokin'.  +++$+++  Barney:  Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.
Robin:  Please say "widows."  +++$+++  Barney:  Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.
Robin:  Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...  +++$+++  Barney:  Trolls.
Robin: ...who could care less about Valentine's Day.  +++$+++  Barney:  Lying trolls.
Lily: I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.  +++$+++  Barney: You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?
Ted: You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.  +++$+++  Barney:  We said you were going to have s*x. We didn't say, "Bring a carry-on."
Ted from 2030: Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night...  +++$+++  Barney:  God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.
Robin:  Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.  +++$+++  Barney:  Enchant. That's French for "What's with the purple?"
Robin:  And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.  +++$+++  Barney:  Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your "fianc" who no one's ever met.
Ted &amp; Marshall: No!  +++$+++  Barney:  Okay, when your "fianc" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.
Robin:  Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle?  +++$+++  Barney:  My elbow slipped!
Lily: Please come home soon.  +++$+++  Barney:  So, you were an Olympic gymnast?
Woman: Silver medal.  +++$+++  Barney:  Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.
Woman: That's what my dad said.  +++$+++  Barney:  And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.
Nora: Oh, hi.  +++$+++  Barney:  Quick question.
Nora: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney:  Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?
Nora: Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?  +++$+++  Barney:  Sure.
Nora: I love Valentine's Day.  +++$+++  Barney:  Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?
Nora: Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?  +++$+++  Barney:  Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?
Nora: We are pitiful.  +++$+++  Barney:  The worst.
Nora: Although there is one difference between you and me.  +++$+++  Barney:  What's that?
Marshall: Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.  +++$+++  Barney:  All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.
Nora: What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?  +++$+++  Barney:  Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.
Woman: Hey, I'm all stretched out!  +++$+++  Barney:  Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.
Marshall: Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.  +++$+++  Barney: ...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.
Nora: Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!  +++$+++  Barney:  Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.
Anna: Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.  +++$+++  Barney:  I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.
Nora: Well, I think I'm heading out, too.  +++$+++  Barney:  What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!
Robin:  Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...  +++$+++  Barney:  What are you talking about?
Robin:  Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.  +++$+++  Barney:  No, I don't. She's gross.
Robin:  Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.  +++$+++  Barney:  Whatever you say.
Robin:  Oh, hey, Nora.  +++$+++  Barney:  Nora...
Ted: Well, that was kind of presumptuous.  +++$+++  Barney:  The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!
Robin:  Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.  +++$+++  Barney:  Hap...?
Ted from 2030: And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day.  +++$+++  Barney:  Oh!
Robin: So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.  +++$+++  Barney: I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.
Nora: Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.  +++$+++  Barney: You want to grab a drink right now?
Nora: No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely.
Robin: How is that a disaster?  +++$+++  Barney: She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...
Barney: She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...  +++$+++  Barney: You want to grab a drink right now?
Nora: No, I'm kind of tired.  +++$+++  Barney: Absolutely.
Barney: Absolutely.  +++$+++  Barney: It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.
Robin: Please, Cheese. You like this girl.  +++$+++  Barney: What? Nora? No, I don't.
Robin: Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.  +++$+++  Barney: That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?
Robin: You like her. You should call her.  +++$+++  Barney: Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.
Robin: That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.  +++$+++  Barney: Totally.
Robin: Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.  +++$+++  Barney: Like Prince.
Lily: No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh. Ha-wink
Lily: Excuse me?  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.
Lily: It's been a while.  +++$+++  Barney: Five weeks, three days by my estimation.
Lily: You should work at a carnival.  +++$+++  Barney: I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.
Robin: Good night. Good night, guys.  +++$+++  Barney: 18 weeks.
Robin: Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...  +++$+++  Barney: Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.
Robin: Throw me one? Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.
Robin: Oh, I see what's going on.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah?
Robin: This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.  +++$+++  Barney: Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my shot?
Robin: Nora met a guy. What?!  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Robin: Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.  +++$+++  Barney: But "L'Amour" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!
Marshall: You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.  +++$+++  Barney: Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is "$12 million," and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.
Marshall: Lily!  +++$+++  Barney: You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.
Robin: Sorry. Who said anything about an...?  +++$+++  Barney: Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.
Robin: No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!
Robin: You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great pen1s comes great responsibility.
Robin: Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.  +++$+++  Barney: Sorry?
Robin: I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.  +++$+++  Barney: Careful, Robin, I'll do it.
Robin: Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.  +++$+++  Barney: Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.
Lily: I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.  +++$+++  Barney: All right, Robin, give it to me.
Robin: Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, "Yeah, Barney, go get her!" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.  +++$+++  Barney: The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?
Robin: It's a five, idiot.  +++$+++  Barney: A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?
Robin: "Moon man language"? What does that even mean?  +++$+++  Barney: How am I supposed to see that's a five?
Robin: Look how you taped this up...  +++$+++  Barney: Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.
Ted from 2030: Kids, the heart is a mysterious muscle. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I... and so did Lily... and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout.  +++$+++  Barney: I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple s*x partners. I'm doing everything right.
Marshall: You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.  +++$+++  Barney: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. "With"? I am not "with" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.
Lily: Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. pen1s feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...
Ted from 2030: Barney said this a lot.  +++$+++  Barney: If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day  Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers  Never date a girl with a hook for a hand
Barney: If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day  Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers  Never date a girl with a hook for a hand  +++$+++  Barney: Never go out with the same girl more than once.
Lily: Then why are you going out with Nora again?  +++$+++  Barney: There is an exception.
Ted from 2030: And it was always the same exception.  +++$+++  Barney:...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot.
Barney:...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot.  +++$+++  Barney: And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it.  sneezes)
Barney: And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it.  sneezes)  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.
Nora: Oh, no. How long have you been sick?  +++$+++  Barney: About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.
Nora: Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...  +++$+++  Barney: Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?
Nora: Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.  +++$+++  Barney: The bed... that's where all the...happens.
Ted from 2030: That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah. Thank you.
Nora: Good night, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Good night, Mommy.
Lily: Wow, she nursed you back to health?  +++$+++  Barney: No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.
Ted: Should have just let you get a dog.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.
Lily: Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?  +++$+++  Barney: No.
Lily: Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?  +++$+++  Barney: Yes!
Lily: Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *
Barney: Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *  +++$+++  Barney: * Bang, bang, bangity bang... *
The cardiologist: Are we done?  +++$+++  Barney: * A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *
The cardiologist: Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine.  +++$+++  Barney: See, Lily? She was worried.
The cardiologist: It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours.  +++$+++  Barney: Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.
The cardiologist: Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, now it doesn't.
The cardiologist: Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be...alarmed about.  +++$+++  Barney: Go on, Doctor.
The cardiologist: What happened at 8:46 p.m. last night?  +++$+++  Barney: Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.
Nora: This might be a little forward, but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest?  +++$+++  Barney: This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.
Nora: Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.  +++$+++  Barney: What's that like?
Nora: So is everything okay?  +++$+++  Barney: My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.
Nora: Oh, I am so sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Thanks.
Nora: Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?
Lily: You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!  +++$+++  Barney: That's exactly what I want, too.
Nate: I'll get 'em.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, guys, this is Nora.
Nora: Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.  +++$+++  Barney: I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.
Nora: How many do you want?  +++$+++  Barney: Three... one of each. You?
Nora: Three. All in an old stone house.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, with ivy growing on it.
Barney: Yeah, with ivy growing on it.  +++$+++  Barney: And we must have a pool.
Nora: We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?  +++$+++  Barney: I really am.
Nora: I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.  +++$+++  Barney: I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...
Lily: Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.
Marshall: Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.
Lily: Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.  +++$+++  Barney: Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?
Lily: Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall?
Marshall: You got nothing on me.  +++$+++  Barney: The calzone?
Marshall: Checkmate.  +++$+++  Barney: Robin.
Robin:  Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...  +++$+++  Barney: The Mr. T dream...
Robin: I'm lost.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted?
Ted: Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.  +++$+++  Barney: The ballet class.
Ted: I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.  +++$+++  Barney: The 'N Sync concert.
Ted: 1998. Cleveland's Gund Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, Ted. The thermos.
Ted: I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.  +++$+++  Barney: I do! So be cool!
Ted: Once?  +++$+++  Barney: Thermos.
Ted from 2030: This was a big deal for Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.
Ted: Not even if she's hot?  +++$+++  Barney: Not even if her mom's hot.
Barney: Not even if her mom's hot.  +++$+++  Barney: I'd love to meet your parents.
Nate: Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.  +++$+++  Barney: No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!
Nora: Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, me, too.
Nora: Do you want to come upstairs?  +++$+++  Barney: I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.
Barney: I'd love to.  There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but... I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants.  +++$+++  Barney: Can you believe...
Ted: Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?  +++$+++  Barney: Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.
Nora: Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!  +++$+++  Barney: I was on the spot. This is your fault.
Nora: My fault?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, with the whole "I want to get married" thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.
Robin:  Hey, have you seen Scooby?  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?
Lily: Day's not over.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.
Lily: No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...
Lily: What time was your dinner reservation?  +++$+++  Barney: Last night? 8:30.
Lily: Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.  +++$+++  Barney: I lied.
Nora: Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.
Nora: I'm confused.  +++$+++  Barney: So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.
Nora: Mom, Dad... this is Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?
Ted: Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted. This is your seduction lounge. s*x swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...
Lily:  We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.
Ted: Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?  +++$+++  Barney: Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.
Lily:  You call the super for a screwdriver?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.
Ted: Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, here's our screwdriver now.  Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself.
Jerry: Barney, I... I got your letter.  +++$+++  Barney: Dad?
Ted: Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?  +++$+++  Barney: Where do I begin?
Jerry : So, I'm not sure how to start this.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. I think I need a drink.
Jerry: Nice order. Up top.  +++$+++  Barney: Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.
Jerry: Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?  +++$+++  Barney: I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.
Barney: I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.  +++$+++  Barney: Make a muscle.
Jerry: There you go.  +++$+++  Barney: Ah!
Barney: Ah!  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.
Barney: Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?
Jerry: Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.  +++$+++  Barney, laughing: You're funny. My dad's funny.
Barney, laughing: You're funny. My dad's funny.  +++$+++  Barney: So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.
Robin: You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?  +++$+++  Barney: Do you... get laid a lot?
Jerry: Big-time. Observe.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.
Jerry: Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.  +++$+++  Barney: You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...
Barney: You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...  +++$+++  Barney:...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.
Jerry: So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, that's cool.
Jerry: Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?  +++$+++  Barney: This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg.
Lily:  Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.  +++$+++  Barney: What do you mean?
Robin: Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.  +++$+++  Barney: First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.
Jerry: That's not what happened.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm not sure how to start this.
Jerry: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: I think I need a drink.
Jerry: Me, too.  +++$+++  Barney: Glen McKenna, neat.
Jerry: Milk, skim.  +++$+++  Barney: Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?
Jerry: I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.  +++$+++  Barney: Wow.
Jerry: I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?
Jerry: No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.
Jerry: Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.
Jerry: The drugs, the alcohol, the women...  +++$+++  Barney: Yes, yes, yes.
Jerry: I was out of control.  +++$+++  Barney: *Out of control.*
Jerry: So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: You ever bang Stevie Nicks?
Jerry: What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.  +++$+++  Barney: Big-time.
Jerry: Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the "Father Knows Breast," there's the "Bush Dynasty," the "Lick Father, Lick Son."
Jerry: Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.  +++$+++  Barney: Why?
Jerry: I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.  +++$+++  Barney: You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.
Lily:  We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Marshall: You're having dinner with him tonight.  +++$+++  Barney: No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.
Robin: Are you sure it's not more than that?  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.
Marshall: No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine, I'll go.
Cherryl: Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.
Cherryl: Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.
Marshall: Hey, Lily,  Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys.  The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie.  +++$+++  Barney: It ages well, that's the thing.
Jerry: J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.  +++$+++  Barney: I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.
JJ: Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.  +++$+++  Barney: J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.
Cherryl: So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?
JJ: I'm 11.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.
JJ: I got a paper route.  +++$+++  Barney: Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?
Cherryl: J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?
JJ: Fourth period?  +++$+++  Barney: Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!
Jerry: Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.  +++$+++  Barney: Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?
Jerry: J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.  +++$+++  Barney: Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.
Jerry: Barney, what is going on?  +++$+++  Barney: This is mine.
Jerry: I don't understand.  +++$+++  Barney: J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.
Jerry: Please, just come down and talk to me.  +++$+++  Barney: Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.
Jerry: Why does that make you so mad?  +++$+++  Barney: Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!
Jerry: Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, "screwed up" doesn't even begin to describe...
Jerry: I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.  +++$+++  Barney: Can you help me with this?
Jerry: Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.  +++$+++  Barney: Bye.
Lily:  Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?  +++$+++  Barney: I'm fine. Hey, Ted.
Ted: Yeah, buddy.  +++$+++  Barney: You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?
Ted: Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.  +++$+++  Barney: No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.
Ted from 2030: But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.
Marshall: I have to quit.  +++$+++  Barney: Quit GNB?! Why?
Marshall: I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...  +++$+++  Barney: Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.
Lily: Baby, you have my full support.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.
Robin:I don't think you know what Spain is.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.
Ted: It's dinero.  +++$+++  Barney: Where? I want his autograph!
Robin:He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. : He was a good boy.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having s*x with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.
Marshall: You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.  +++$+++  Barney: No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!
Lily: I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.  +++$+++  Barney: It starts with an... "L?"
Girl: It rhymes with your name.  +++$+++  Barney: And I said my name was...?
Ted: Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play "Who's Hot and Who's Scott?"  +++$+++  Barney: It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.
Marshall: Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.  +++$+++  Barney: I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.
Robin: Hershel?  +++$+++  Barney: What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.
Lily: Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.  +++$+++  Barney: There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?
Marshall: Barney, I'm not playing...  +++$+++  Barney: Just come back to GNB already!
Marshall: Thanks, baby.  Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper.  +++$+++  Barney: That's how I'm gonna use mine.
Robin: Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?  +++$+++  Barney: Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.
Robin:Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. "Barney, we have to talk about your father." "Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil." "Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session "between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute." I don't need this!
Lily: Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right?  Perfect. Let's go.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?
Marshall: Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.
Robin:  Oh, my God!  +++$+++  Barney: How long have you been there?
Robin: Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, no, I'm fine.
Robin: Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?  +++$+++  Barney:Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?
Robin: Yeah.  +++$+++  Barney:Right. So, um... Chinese?
Man: My bag? Oh, no. I got it.  +++$+++  Barney: There's nothing to talk about.
Robin: You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.  +++$+++  Barney: I don't want to talk about it, okay?
Robin: Why not?  +++$+++  Barney: Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.
Robin: I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... : ticking.  +++$+++  Barney: That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?
Robin: No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.  +++$+++  Barney: Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.
Robin: Huh?  +++$+++  Barney: It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.
Barney: It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.
Marshall: Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.  +++$+++  Barney: I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...
Barney: I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...  +++$+++  Barney:...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted.  You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?
Marshall: We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.  +++$+++  Barney, weakly: Thank you, Marshall.  Marshall... can I ask one final favor, my friend?
Marshall: Yes, of course, of course... anything.  +++$+++  Barney: Eat this meatball sub.
Marshall: Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...  +++$+++  Barney: I don't have much time!
Marshall: Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?  +++$+++  Barney, with a mean laugh: I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't-- 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce!
Jerry: Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz kill of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.  +++$+++  Barney: What? That's... What is that word you taught me? "Bull" something?
Jerry: But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.  +++$+++  Barney: But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.
Jerry: Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?  +++$+++  Barney: A drunk audience.
Ted from 2030: This time it was Barney who did the walking.  +++$+++  Barney: Bye.
Ted from 2030: And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later...  +++$+++  Barney: I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.
Marshall: Mmm. Your dad?  +++$+++  Barney: My dad!
Barney: My dad!  +++$+++  Barney: Barney Stinson.
Jerry: Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?  +++$+++  Barney: Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.
Jerry: Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... "Crazy Jerry"? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?  +++$+++  Barney: You do not know how right you are.
Barney: You do not know how right you are.  +++$+++  Barney: Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.
Ted: You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.  +++$+++  Barney: I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.
Robin: Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.  +++$+++  Barney:Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?
Barney:Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.
Lily: That's why you brought these guys.  +++$+++  Barney:No. That's why I brought these guys.  I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards.
Marshall: Improvements?!  +++$+++  Barney:Yeah.
Marshall: Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.  +++$+++  Barney:Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.
Marshall: Gross!  +++$+++  Barney:Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.
Ted: Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, "Man is least himself when he talks..."  +++$+++  Barney:Ted, card.
Ted: Ah. You're right... "No quoting Oscar Wilde."  +++$+++  Barney:Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.
Robin: Aw, man! Why?  +++$+++  Barney: I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.
Ted: How good was that movie?  +++$+++  Barney: And... hence new identities.
Ted from 2030: And so Barney's dad finally showed up.  +++$+++  Barney: Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.
Marshall: Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.  +++$+++  Barney: Lily, his wife.
Robin: Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.
Jerry: So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...
Marshall: Um, those places shut down a long time ago.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, no.
Lily: Where's where Was was, isn't it?  +++$+++  Barney: No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?
Marshall: That's wrong. That's not Wrong.  +++$+++  Barney: Guys, focus.
Lily: I thought Focus was closed.  +++$+++  Barney: No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.
Lily: Guys, shut up.  +++$+++  Barney: No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.
Marshall: For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lam.  +++$+++  Barney: It's hopeless, isn't it?
Marshall: Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.  +++$+++  Barney: I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!
Ted, whispering to Robin: You owe me one.  +++$+++  Barney: Man, isn't this place great?
Marshall: And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.
Marshall: What?  +++$+++  Barney: Let's do shots.
Jerry: Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.  +++$+++  Barney: No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? "Never stop partying."
Jerry, looking horrified: I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that.  +++$+++  Barney: You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?
Jerry: But I want to hang out with you.  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.
Jerry: Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!  +++$+++  Barney: Can you believe it? This is awesome!
Robin: Barney, how is that awesome?  +++$+++  Barney: I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.
Lily: So our usual wager. Deal.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?
Jerry: Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?  +++$+++  Barney: No, of course not. I... I just...
Jerry: Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!
Jerry, to a big tattoed biker: You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! You don't even know!  +++$+++  Barney: : Hey, hey! There we go!
Jerry: Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh...!
Jerry: Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.  +++$+++  Barney: It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...
Jerry: Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!  +++$+++  Barney: What?
Jerry: Here you go.  +++$+++  Barney, laughing: Whoa!
Jerry: Bottoms up, amigo!  +++$+++  Barney: But all those crazy things you did.
Jerry: Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?  +++$+++  Barney: A drunk audience.
Jerry, to a dummy wearing a biker outfit: You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy!  +++$+++  Barney: No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!
Jerry: Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh...!
Barney: Oh...!  +++$+++  Barney: What just happened?
Jerry: I... I just puked on the hood of that... ...police car.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, why do all those things?
Jerry: I figured if I showed you what... "never stop partying" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well.  +++$+++  Barney: You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!
Jerry: I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.
Jerry: Perhaps.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too.  Abracadabra!
Marshall: Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?  +++$+++  Barney: We need someplace to hide.
Jerry: Where?  +++$+++  Barney: No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.
Jerry: Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.  +++$+++  Barney: Step on it! Jerry...
Jerry: Do not step on it.  +++$+++  Barney: Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.
Jerry: The laws are there to protect...  +++$+++  Barney: This is no time for laws!
Jerry: Buckle up, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I am not going to buckle up!
Man: And her fianc? The guy's like a two.  +++$+++  Barney: How did you do it?
Jerry: Do what?  +++$+++  Barney: How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...
Jerry: You're drifting.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...
Jerry: No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.
Jerry: Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.  +++$+++  Barney:So how do you do it?
Jerry: A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.  +++$+++  Barney:Maybe I've met her already.
Jerry: And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.  +++$+++  Barney:Maybe some other time.
Jerry: Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.  +++$+++  Barney:I'm going fishing with my dad.
Barney:I'm going fishing with my dad.  +++$+++  Barney: This... sucks.
Zoey: If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.  +++$+++  Barney: Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to "Hot For Teacher." Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.
Robin: Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...
Ted: Dude, that's my girlfriend.  +++$+++  Barney: Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?
Lily: Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.  +++$+++  Barney: Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.
Marshall: Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?  +++$+++  Barney: Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?
Lily: That was on purpose!  +++$+++  Barney: I mean this is really like...
Marshall: Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!  +++$+++  Barney: No. I' was... I was...
Marshall, to the girl Barney is talking to: Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with.  +++$+++  Barney: Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't.
Marshall: Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.  +++$+++  Barney: Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?
Marshall: That's it!  +++$+++  Barney: Kent! Kent!
Marshall: Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!  +++$+++  Barney: That's what you get, you traitor!
Marshall: Oh, really? Really?  +++$+++  Barney: Yeah. Really.
All: Ten, nine, eight...  +++$+++  Barney: I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.
Robin: The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.  +++$+++  Barney: Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...
Ted: Hey, where are our chicken wings?  +++$+++  Barney: Show me chicken wings!
Lily: I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.  +++$+++  Barney: Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?
Marshall: Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?  +++$+++  Barney: What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?
Marshall: I showed up with wet hair once! Once!  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, my God.
Marshall: See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.  +++$+++  Barney: Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...
Marshall: Oh God, I didn't even think of that...  +++$+++  Barney: It made me wonder, "What could I have done to make him stay?"
Marshall: Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.
Lily: What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?  +++$+++  Barney: Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.
Marshall: I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: I love you.
Barney: I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: Uh, no. N-Not right...
Robin: Morning. Who wants breakfast?  +++$+++  Barney: You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?
Marshall: I love you.  +++$+++  Barney: I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...
Robin: We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.  +++$+++  Barney: What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?
Ted: Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.  +++$+++  Barney: Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...
Lily: What happened to your leg?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some "sympathy points". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of "Man of La Mancha." What do you think?
Ted: Lose the cast.  +++$+++  Barney: A one-man show... I love it!
Lily: Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?  +++$+++  Barney: You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.
Ted : The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous.  +++$+++  Barney: Hi Nora, thank you for coming.
Nora: What happened to your neck?  +++$+++  Barney: My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...
Nora: Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.  +++$+++  Barney, turning: What? Where? Oh, and sh1t.
Nora: Breasts...  +++$+++  Barney: Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.
Nora: What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?  +++$+++  Barney: Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.
Nora: Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.  +++$+++  Barney: Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.
Nora: OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?  +++$+++  Barney: Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.
Nora: More than once?  +++$+++  Barney: More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.
Nora: They were worth what?  +++$+++  Barney: Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.
Nora: What was the lie?  +++$+++  Barney: You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?
Nora: A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.  +++$+++  Barney: You are good.
Ted : Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep.  +++$+++  Barney: I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic.
Nora: Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black.
Pete: I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!  +++$+++  Barney: And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: "I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... "
Nora: Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.  +++$+++  Barney: So that was cool. I can remember, or...?
Nora: Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.  +++$+++  Barney: Well, I count three for and one against.
Nora: How can you still believe you have a chance with me?  +++$+++  Barney: Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.
Nora: How I know this is not a lie?  +++$+++  Barney: I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.
Nora: Goodbye Barney.  +++$+++  Barney: I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.
Lily: But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, "Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! "  +++$+++  Barney: Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!
Robin: Barney, what are you doing here?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned.
Lily: What happened to your leg?  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some "sympathy points". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of "Man of La Mancha." What do you think?

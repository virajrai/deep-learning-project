Robin: I'm sorry.  +++$+++  Barney: Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. .
Lily: Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.  +++$+++  Barney: I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?
Marshall: Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.  +++$+++  Barney: Really? Laid, you say?
Marshall: You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.  +++$+++  Barney: She hot?
Marshall: Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.  +++$+++  Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.
Robin: A what?  +++$+++  Barney: A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.
Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?  +++$+++  Barney: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.
Marshall: I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...  +++$+++  Barney: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.

Narrator: Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.  +++$+++  Barney:...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full.
Ted: I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.  +++$+++  Barney: When will you be ready?
Narrator: I grew my breakup beard.  +++$+++  Barney: Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.
Narrator: I repainted the apartment.  +++$+++  Barney: Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah.
Narrator: And the truth is, I was doing really good.  +++$+++  Barney: Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get "Cirque de So-Laid". What up?
Marshall: That's my wife.  +++$+++  Barney: Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?
Gael: Gael.  +++$+++  Barney: Kyle?
Ted:  What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.  +++$+++  Barney: That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.
Gael: Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.  +++$+++  Barney: How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.
